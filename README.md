# Presidential Debates Data Visualization

I'd like to build a quick sketch looking at the flow of conversation for the first 2020 Presidental Debate. The term 'debate' should be used lightly here to describe what that was. 

I think it would be really interesting to look at how long each of the three, Wallace, Biden and Trump, talked for. How long did they talk. How much did they talk over each other. 



Ideas for this project:
- Use the trope of liberals/dems being on the left and conservatives/republicans on the right to format a text display of the debate with Wallace being in the middle. The obvious red vs blue colour coding here.
- Look at past presidental debates to compare what their visual fingerprint looks like in comparison. I hope this would show just how beyond the norm the first Trump / Biden debate was.
- I need to find data sources for these previous transcripts.

This connects to an old (like 2004 old) data viz I built for one of the Bush / Kerry debates where I used screen shots of the debates to create an image of two (twin) towers.
