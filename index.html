    <h2>Project Description:</h2>
    <p>On September 29, 2020, the US held their first presidential debate between President Trump and former Vice
      President Biden. The debate immediately became known not for what was said or policies debated but for the
      interuptions and complete lack of decorum. One anchor called it a &quot;shitshow&quot; and to quote an anchor from
      CNN:
</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;That was a hot mess inside a dumpster fire inside a train wreck. That was the worst debate I have ever
        seen. It wasn't even a debate. It was a disgrace. And it's primarily because of President Trump, who spent the
        entire time interrupting not abiding by the rules he agreed to.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So what does this debate look like when visualized? Are all of these interruptions visible? Is it possible to
      tell who is interrupting the most?</p>
    <p>To test out this idea, I am using a transcript from <a
        href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-1st-presidential-debate-transcript-2020">Rev
        Transcription Services</a>. I have processed the data to include the times when each person speaks. You can find
      the ways I adjusted the data in the <a href="https://github.com/sspboyd/Presidential_Debates/blob/master/date_munging.js">data_munging.js file</a>.</p>
    <p>The visualization is built using <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a>. And as of today (Tuesday, Oct 20, 2020),
      the visualization is still being adjusted and tweaked.</p>
    <p>Further questions to be asked are how does this debate compare to previous debates and possibly future debates
      between Trump and Biden?</p>
