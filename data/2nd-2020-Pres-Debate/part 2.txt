Donald Trump (00:00):
... them. They both want you to lose because there has been nobody tougher to Russia between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia, between the sanctions, between all of what I've done with NATO. I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra $130 billion going to $420 billion a year. That's to guard against Russia. I sold, while he was selling pillows and sheets, I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.

Donald Trump (00:33):
And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the submarine port, you remember that very well, during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money, and they probably still are. But now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails, the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice-president when some of this was happening, and it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.

Kristen Welker (01:29):
Vice-President Biden, you may respond-

Joe Biden (01:31):
[crosstalk 00:01:31].

Kristen Welker (01:31):
... and then I do want to follow up on the election security.

Joe Biden (01:33):
I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learned that this president paid 50 times the tax in China as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country, whatsoever, ever, number one.

Joe Biden (01:57):
Number two, this is a president... I have released all of my tax returns, 22 years, go look at them, 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia's paying you a lot. China's paying you a lot on your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new golf course you have overseas. So, what's going on here? Release your tax return or stop talking about corruption.

Kristen Welker (02:32):
President Trump, your response.

Donald Trump (02:33):
First of all, I called my accountants, underwrote it, I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it. And it'll show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, "What did I pay?" They said, "Sir, you prepaid tens of millions of dollars." I prepaid my tax, over the last number of years, tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that. Nobody told you that.

Kristen Welker (03:11):
Did your accountant tell you [crosstalk 00:03:11]?

Donald Trump (03:11):
Excuse me. And it wasn't written. Whenever they write this, they keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee, but let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one.

Donald Trump (03:23):
Number two, I don't make money from China. You do. I don't make money from Ukraine. You do. I don't make money from Russia. You made $3.5 million, Joe, and your son gave you, they even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not, but you're the big man, I think. Your son said we have to give 10% to the big men. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.

Kristen Welker (03:50):
All right, gentlemen. I want to ask you both some questions about all of this, but...

Joe Biden (03:52):
I have to respond to that.

Kristen Welker (03:53):
I'm going to let you both respond very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes, did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?

Donald Trump (04:02):
As soon as the auditors finish. I get treated worse than the tea party got treated, because I have a lot of people in there-

Kristen Welker (04:07):
[crosstalk 00:04:06].

Donald Trump (04:08):
... deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled until I decide to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it, but I have paid millions and millions of dollars and it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid [crosstalk 00:04:32].

Kristen Welker (04:31):
Okay. I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly. Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.

Joe Biden (04:43):
Why did he... he's been saying this for four years, show us, just show us, stop playing around. You've been saying for four years you're going to release your taxes.

Donald Trump (04:52):
Everybody knows.

Joe Biden (04:53):
Nobody knows, Mr. President. What they do know is you're not paying your taxes, or you're paying taxes that are so low, when last time he said, what he paid, he said, I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system. Come on. Come on, folks.

Donald Trump (05:10):
So...

Kristen Welker (05:11):
[crosstalk 00:05:11] President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you on this.

Joe Biden (05:13):
Sure.

Donald Trump (05:14):
I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied of my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this, Mueller and 18 angry Democrats and FBI agents all over the place spent $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent $1 million on you, Joe, I could find plenty wrong because the kind of things-

Kristen Welker (05:52):
All right.

Donald Trump (05:52):
... that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken, I mean, your brother made money in Iraq-

Kristen Welker (05:58):
Let me...

Donald Trump (05:58):
... millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well, you have houses all over the place. You live very well.

Kristen Welker (06:08):
All right, gentlemen. Let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice-President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China and for a Ukrainian energy company when you were vice-president, in retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?

Joe Biden (06:24):
Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine. We had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned of Burisma, a company that somehow, I had done something wrong, yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath, who work for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out U.S. policy, not one single solitary thing was out of line, not a single thing, number one.

Joe Biden (06:57):
Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do and did not do because it never ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about, what are you talking about, China. I have not had... the only guy who made money from China is this guy. He's the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.

Kristen Welker (07:25):
President Trump-

Donald Trump (07:25):
[crosstalk 00:07:25]...

Kristen Welker (07:26):
... let me ask my question to you [crosstalk 00:07:28]...

Donald Trump (07:28):
But could I just one thing?

Kristen Welker (07:29):
Very quickly.

Donald Trump (07:29):
His son didn't have a job for a long time, was, sadly, no longer in the military service, I won't get into that, and he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice-president, Burisma, not the best reputation in the world, I hear they paid him $183,000 a month, listen to this, $183,000, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That's 100% dishonest.

Kristen Welker (07:55):
All right. I'm going to let the vice-president respond to that quickly, and then I need to get to a question to you. Very quickly, Mr. Vice-President.

Joe Biden (08:01):
No basis for that. Everybody investigated that. No one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.

Kristen Welker (08:03):
Okay. President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?

Donald Trump (08:19):
I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to, which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed, the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe. And then I decided, because I was going to do... I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it and I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.

Kristen Welker (08:54):
Okay.

Donald Trump (08:54):
Excuse me. And then, unlike him where he's vice-president and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the vice-president of the United States and his son, his brother, and his other brother are getting rich. They're like a vacuum cleaner. They're sucking up money [crosstalk 00:09:20].

Kristen Welker (09:19):
Okay. President Trump, thank you. We do need to move on.

Joe Biden (09:21):
Not true.

Kristen Welker (09:22):
I do want to ask you, Vice-President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay? And please be specific, what would that look like?

Joe Biden (09:41):
What I'd make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit of the China to go up, not down, with China, up, not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to have a partner in China. It's 51%, we would not do that at all, number one.

Joe Biden (10:03):
Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi and when I was still vice-president, he said we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea. You can't fly through them. I said we're going to fly through them. We just flew B-52, B-1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention. They have to play by the rules. And what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs, like in North Korea and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger [inaudible 00:10:36] all of our friends, all of our allies. We make up only... we're 25%, 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to China, "These are the rules. You play by them, or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them economically."

Joe Biden (10:54):
That's the way I will run it, and that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice-president.

Kristen Welker (11:01):
All right. Let's talk about North Korea.

Donald Trump (11:02):
No, no, no.

Kristen Welker (11:03):
Let...

Donald Trump (11:03):
Excuse me. No, I have to...

Joe Biden (11:03):
... and Vice President.

Kristen Welker (11:03):
All right, let's talk about North Korea-

Donald Trump (11:03):
Excuse me. No, I have to respond to that.

Kristen Welker (11:05):
Okay. Very quickly, and then we're going to move on to North Korea.

Donald Trump (11:07):
His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China to ...

Joe Biden (11:08):
Not true.

Donald Trump (11:10):
... after spending 10 minutes in office and being in Air Force Two. Number one. Number two, there's a very strong email talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.

Kristen Welker (11:22):
President Trump, on China policy-

Joe Biden (11:24):
That's not true.

Kristen Welker (11:24):
... though, what specifically-

Donald Trump (11:24):
No, but wait a minute.

Kristen Welker (11:25):
What are you going to do, what specifically are you going to do to make China pay? You've said you're going to make them pay.

Donald Trump (11:30):
First of all, China is paying. They're paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.

Kristen Welker (11:35):
New sanctions?

Donald Trump (11:36):
I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.

Joe Biden (11:39):
Tax payer's money.

Donald Trump (11:41):
It's what?

Joe Biden (11:42):
Taxpayer's money. Didn't come from China.

Donald Trump (11:44):
No, no. You know who the taxpayer is? It's called China.

Joe Biden (11:46):
Not true.

Donald Trump (11:46):
China pays 28 billion, and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know got the money? Our farmers, our great farmers, because they were targeted. You never charged them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel industry.

Kristen Welker (12:06):
Okay.

Donald Trump (12:06):
And now we have a steel industry.

Kristen Welker (12:07):
Okay. Vice President Biden, your response, please.

Joe Biden (12:09):
My response is, look, there's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're a middle-class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, "Well, we can't get new tires. They're bald, because we have to wait another month or so." Or, "Are we going to be able to pay the mortgage?" Or, "Who's going to tell her she can't go back to community college?" They're the decisions you're making, and the middle-class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, they're in trouble. We should be talking about your families, but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.

Donald Trump (12:53):
That is a typical statement.

Joe Biden (12:54):
I want to talk about North Korea.

Donald Trump (12:56):
Excuse me. Just for one second, please.

Kristen Welker (12:57):
10 seconds, Mr. President. 10 seconds.

Donald Trump (12:59):
That's a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks, "The family around the table, everything." Just a typical politician when I see that. I'm not a typical politician.

Kristen Welker (13:07):
Let's talk about North Korea now.

Donald Trump (13:08):
That's why I got elected. Let's get off the subject of China. Let's talk about sitting around the table. Come on, Joe. You could do better.

Kristen Welker (13:16):
We're going to talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un three times. You've talked about your beautiful letters with him. You've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship you forged.

Donald Trump (13:38):
No.

Kristen Welker (13:38):
Just 30 seconds here because we need to get onto the next topic.

Donald Trump (13:40):
So when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning, had a great conversation. Was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said, "The biggest problem we have is North Korea." He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what? It would be a nuclear war. And he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him. Different kind of a guy, but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of a relationship. We have a very good relationship and there's no war. And about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, "Oh, there's going to be trouble." I said, "No, they're not, because he's not going to do that." And I was right. Look, instead of being in a war where millions of people, Seoul is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people. Millions of people would be dead right now. We don't have a war and I have a good relationship.

Kristen Welker (14:31):
President Trump, that's 30 seconds. Vice President Biden to you. North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to reign in this persistent threatening?

Joe Biden (14:42):
Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because I made it clear as a spokesperson for the illustration when I went to China that I said, "Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces here? Why are you continue to do military maneuvers with South Korea?" I said, "Because North Korea is a problem, and we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up and help. If not, it's going to continue." What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea. He's talked about his good buddy, who's a thug, a thug. And he talks about how we're better off. And they have much more capable missiles, able to reach us territory much more easily than they ever did before.

Kristen Welker (15:31):
Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden. You've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong-un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?

Joe Biden (15:39):
On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.

Kristen Welker (15:48):
All right. Let's move on to American families.

Donald Trump (15:51):
Kristen.

Kristen Welker (15:51):
Very quickly, 10 seconds, President Trump.

Donald Trump (15:53):
They tried to meet with him. He wouldn't do it. He didn't like Obama. He didn't like him. He wouldn't do it.

Kristen Welker (15:59):
Okay, I've got to give him a chance to respond to that before we move on.

Donald Trump (16:01):
I know for a fact. They tried. We wouldn't do it. And that's okay. You know what? North Korea, we're not in a war. We have a good relationship. People don't understand. Having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.

Kristen Welker (16:12):
President Trump, we have to move on, because we have a lot of questions to get to. Your response.

Joe Biden (16:15):
We had a good relationship with Hitler before he, in fact, invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said, "We're going to talk about denuclearization. We're not going to legitimize you and we're going to continue to push stronger and stronger sanctions on you." That's why he wouldn't meet with us.

Kristen Welker (16:36):
All right, let's move on.

Donald Trump (16:38):
And it didn't happen.

Kristen Welker (16:38):
Let's move on and talk about American families.

Donald Trump (16:38):
Excuse me. He left me a mess. Kristen.

Kristen Welker (16:40):
President Trump. Okay

Donald Trump (16:41):
They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess, and in fact, if you remember the first two or three months. It was a very dangerous period in my first three months before we worked things out a little bit.

Kristen Welker (16:54):
Okay.

Donald Trump (16:54):
There was a very day. They left us a mess, and Obama would be, I think, the first to say it, was the single biggest problem he thought that our country [crosstalk 00:17:03].

Kristen Welker (17:03):
Okay, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is healthcare, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the Supreme Court does overturn that law, there's 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.

Donald Trump (17:40):
First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, I terminated. It's gone. Now, it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, run it as well as you can, to my people, great people, run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down. Everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it'll be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare, because without the individual mandate, it's much different.

Donald Trump (18:36):
Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better healthcare, much better. We'll always protect people with pre-existing. So I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new, beautiful healthcare. The Democrats will do it, because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think we're going to win the House. You'll see, but I think we're going to win the House. But come up with a better healthcare, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And one thing very important, we have 180 million people out there that have great private healthcare. Far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their healthcare. People that have been successful, middle-income people, been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families. Under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine, he won't even have a choice, they want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job at healthcare, and we're going to do even better. Just you watch.

Kristen Welker (19:43):
Okay. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your healthcare plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.

Joe Biden (19:56):
What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option, and become Bidencare. The public option is an option that says that if you in fact do not have the wherewithal, if you qualify for Medicaid and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition, that doesn't exist now, by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance, the reason why I had such a fight with 20 candidates for the nomination was I support private insurance. That's why. Not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance unless they chose they wanted to go to something else.

Joe Biden (20:59):
Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we actually protect pre-existing. There's no way he can protect pre-existing conditions. None, zero. You can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. He's never come up with a plan. I guess we're going to get the pre-existing condition plan the same time we got the infrastructure plan that we waited for since '17, '18, '19, and 20. I still have a few more minutes. I know you're getting anxious. The fact is that he's already cost the American people, because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have it under Obamacare and over 110 million people with pre-existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre-existing conditions, what are they going to do?

Kristen Welker (21:51):
I have a follow-up for you Vice President Biden. It relates to something that President Trump said. He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your healthcare plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes-

Kristen Welker (22:03):
Concerns that your healthcare plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a healthcare system run entirely by the government. What's your response to that?

Joe Biden (22:09):
I say it's ridiculous. It's like saying that the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes it a socialist plan. Look, the difference between the president and I... I think healthcare is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable healthcare, and I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions, as well as a whole range of other people who, in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity to have healthcare for their children. How many of you at home are worried and rolling around in bed tonight, wondering what in God's name you're going to do if you get sick, because you've lost your health insurance and your company's gone under? We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.

Kristen Welker (23:00):
President Trump-

Donald Trump (23:00):
Excuse me. He was there-

Kristen Welker (23:01):
... your response.

Donald Trump (23:02):
... for 47 years. He didn't do it. He was now there as vice president for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago. It was three and three quarters... It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it. His vice president, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more. Bernie Sanders wants it. The Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine, just like you want it with fracking. "We're not going to have fracking. We're going to stop fracking. We're going to stop fracking." Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets a nomination, where he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, "Oh, we're going to have fracking." And you never ask that question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say.

Joe Biden (23:50):
By the way-

Donald Trump (23:50):
But somebody should ask the question.

Joe Biden (23:52):
You can ask it.

Donald Trump (23:52):
He goes for a year, there will be no fracking.

Kristen Welker (23:55):
We do have a number-

Donald Trump (23:56):
There will be no petroleum-

Kristen Welker (23:56):
We have a number of topics we're going to get to.

Donald Trump (24:00):
No, no. But that's a big question.

Kristen Welker (24:01):
We're going to get to a number of topics-

Donald Trump (24:01):
It's the same thing with socialized medicine.

Joe Biden (24:03):
I have to respond to healthcare.

Kristen Welker (24:04):
Vice President, your response please.

Joe Biden (24:04):
My response is, people deserve to have affordable healthcare, period. Period, period, period. And the Biden care proposal will in fact provide for that affordable healthcare, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money. It's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums. You can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on healthcare. Not a thing.

Donald Trump (24:37):
Kristen, when he says-

Kristen Welker (24:38):
Very quickly, then I want to talk about what's happening on Capitol Hill.

Donald Trump (24:39):
When he says public option, he's talking about socialized medicine and healthcare. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying-

Joe Biden (24:49):
Wrong.

Donald Trump (24:49):
... and destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. Bernie Sanders tried it in his state.

Joe Biden (24:56):
Bernie.

Donald Trump (24:56):
He tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor. They wanted to make it work.

Kristen Welker (25:00):
Okay. Let's hear-

Donald Trump (25:01):
It was impossible to work.

Kristen Welker (25:02):
Let's let Vice President Biden respond-

Donald Trump (25:04):
It doesn't work.

Joe Biden (25:05):
He's a very confused guy. He thinks he's running against somebody else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation that is going to destroy Medicare... This is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, "If in fact..." That's Social Security. "If in fact he continues his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023 with no way to make up for it." This is the guy who's tried to cut Medicare. The idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.

Donald Trump (25:48):
He tried to get rid of-

Kristen Welker (25:49):
10 seconds, Mr. President, and then I have to go to another question.

Donald Trump (25:49):
He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. Years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. One thing. But this is the guy-

Kristen Welker (25:57):
All right. Let's move on. I'm going to move on.

Donald Trump (25:59):
... that when they announced last week-

Kristen Welker (26:00):
Mr. President, I have to move on to the next question or else we're not going to have time to talk about it.

Donald Trump (26:02):
They say the stock market will boom if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash.

Kristen Welker (26:09):
Okay. Let's move on to the next question.

Donald Trump (26:09):
The biggest analysts are saying that.

Joe Biden (26:10):
May I respond?

Kristen Welker (26:10):
Very quickly.

Joe Biden (26:12):
Look, the idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three years, during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to Wall Street, 700 billion more dollars. 700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?

Kristen Welker (26:41):
Let's talk about what's happening on Capitol Hill.

Donald Trump (26:44):
401(k)s. Kristen, 401(k)s are through the roof.

Kristen Welker (26:45):
We're going to move on.

Donald Trump (26:46):
People's stock are through the roof.

Kristen Welker (26:47):
All right.

Donald Trump (26:48):
And he doesn't come from Scranton. He lived there for a short period of time before he even knew it.

Kristen Welker (26:54):
Okay. We're going to move on to the next question.

Donald Trump (26:55):
And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will show you that.

Kristen Welker (26:57):
Let me move on to my next question, gentlemen.

Donald Trump (26:57):
They understand.

Kristen Welker (26:58):
As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more Americans have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here.

Donald Trump (27:18):
Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.

Kristen Welker (27:20):
But you're the president.

Donald Trump (27:22):
I do. But I still have to get, unfortunately... That's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything because she'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3rd. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing, and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one, she doesn't want. It's near the election. Because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.

Kristen Welker (27:50):
All right, Mr. Vice President-

Joe Biden (27:51):
By the way, as you know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't pass it. He will be able to pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn't he talking to his Republican friends?

Kristen Welker (28:02):
Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden because-

Donald Trump (28:04):
If we made a deal, the Republicans will pass it.

Kristen Welker (28:05):
Let me ask Vice President Biden a question. You are the leader of the Democratic party. Why have you not pushed the Democrats to get a deal for the American people?

Joe Biden (28:13):
I have, and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. It's not new. It's been out there. This HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the recovery act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budgets and states that have to balance their budgets. And then they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they could keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, "Let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt." Come on. What's the matter with these guys?

Donald Trump (28:56):
The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run, high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrat cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars, to these guys. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And I'd love to do that. I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of spending on things that had nothing to do with COVID, as per your question. But it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.

Kristen Welker (29:39):
All right. I want to-

Joe Biden (29:40):
By the way, if I get elected, I'm not going to... I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm going to be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themself in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue, cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers, because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.

Kristen Welker (30:10):
I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners these days. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You of course support a $15 federal minimum wage.

Joe Biden (30:24):
I do, because I think one of the things we're going to have to do is we're going to have to bail them out too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able... They call it PPP. Money is supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they can deal with their businesses being open safely, schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help. The businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. These guys will not help them. It's not giving them any of the money.

Kristen Welker (31:05):
We are going to move on to immigration, but I want to get-

Donald Trump (31:06):
Excuse me. One thing very quickly. He said we have to help our small businesses by raising the minimum wage. That's not helping. I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option.

Kristen Welker (31:21):
You said very recently-

Donald Trump (31:22):
It's very important. We have to help our small businesses.

Kristen Welker (31:25):
You said-

Donald Trump (31:25):
How are you helping your small businesses when you're forcing wages? What's going to happen, and what's been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees.

Kristen Welker (31:35):
You said very recently-

Joe Biden (31:35):
Not true, by the way.

Kristen Welker (31:36):
... you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Donald Trump (31:39):
Say it. Say it.

Kristen Welker (31:39):
You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Donald Trump (31:44):
What I really like, and I would consider it to an extent-

Kristen Welker (31:46):
In a second administration?

Donald Trump (31:47):
But what I really like... In a second administration. But not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I've lived-

Joe Biden (31:55):
Every-

Donald Trump (31:56):
... in different places. I know different places. They're all different. Some places, $ 15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 would be ruinings.

Kristen Welker (32:05):
Okay, President Trump, thank you. Quick response Vice President Biden.

Joe Biden (32:09):
No one should work one job, be below poverty. People are making six, seven, eight bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that puts you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business. That is simply not true.

Kristen Welker (32:34):
We're going to talk about immigration.

Joe Biden (32:35):
It's an [crosstalk 00:32:35]-

Kristen Welker (32:37):
We're going to talk about immigration now, gentlemen. And we're going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4,000 kids. You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?

Donald Trump (32:57):
Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels...

Donald Trump (33:03):
[inaudible 00:33:00] and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and they used to use them to get into our country. We now have as strong a border as we've ever had. We're over 400 miles of brand new wall. You see the numbers. And we let people in, but they have to come in legally and they come in through [crosstalk 00:00:17]-

Kristen Welker (33:17):
But how will you reunite these kids with their families, Mr. President?

Donald Trump (33:20):
But let me just tell you. Let me just tell you. They built cages. They used to say I built the cages, and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper, and it was the picture of these horrible cages and they said, "Look at these cages. President Trump built them." And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him. They built cages.

Kristen Welker (33:39):
Do you have a plan to reunite the kids with their families?

Donald Trump (33:39):
Yes. We're working on it very... We're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come out without the parents. They come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs.

Kristen Welker (33:48):
Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response, and then another question to you.

Joe Biden (33:52):
These 500-plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. "Be real tough. We're really strong." And guess what? They cannot... Coyotes didn't bring them over. Their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation.

Kristen Welker (34:18):
Let me ask you a followup question.

Donald Trump (34:19):
Kristen, they did it. We changed the policy. They did it. We changed.

Kristen Welker (34:22):
Your response to that?

Joe Biden (34:22):
We did not separate the [crosstalk 00:34:25]-

Donald Trump (34:26):
They built the cages. Who built the cages, Joe?

Joe Biden (34:27):
Let's talk about what we're talking about.

Kristen Welker (34:28):
Who built the cages, Joe?

Joe Biden (34:29):
Let's talk about what we're talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped... Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated, and now they cannot find over 500 of the sets of those parents, and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal.

Kristen Welker (34:49):
Let me ask you about [crosstalk 00:34:50] in 10 seconds and then I need to ask [crosstalk 00:34:53].

Donald Trump (34:50):
Kristen, I will say this. They went down. We brought reporters, everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean.

Kristen Welker (34:58):
But some of them haven't been reunited with their families.

Donald Trump (35:00):
They have gotten such good... But just ask one question. Who built the cages? I'd love you to ask him that. Who built the cages, Joe?

Kristen Welker (35:05):
Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama Administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations, as well as, family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?

Joe Biden (35:23):
Because we made a mistake made. It took too long to get it right. Took too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is I've made it very clear. Within a 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all of those so-called dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy and they want to do that is they've gone to they've never seen before. I can imagine. You're five years old. Your parents are taking across the Rio Grande River and it's illegal. And you say, "Oh, no, Mom. Leave me here. I'm not going to go with you." They been here. Many of them are model citizens. Over 20,000 of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.

Kristen Welker (36:24):
President Trump, your reaction.

Donald Trump (36:24):
Kristen, he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed. Without having a specific, we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with. But he had eight years he was Vice President. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.

Kristen Welker (36:47):
Vice President Biden, your response.

Joe Biden (36:48):
The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact you had a family came across and they were arrested, they in fact were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what? They showed up for a hearing. And this is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before in America. That's never happened before in America. You come to the United States and you make your case that, "I seek asylum based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law." They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.

Kristen Welker (37:27):
President Trump, your response. 30 seconds. And then we'll move on.

Donald Trump (37:29):
So important. It just shows that he has no understanding of immigration, of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in. A rapist would come in. A very bad person would come in. We would take their name. We have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back. We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, "Come back in two years, three years. We're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason. We're going to give you a court case." When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really... I hate to say this, but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back, but there are very, very few.

Kristen Welker (38:15):
Okay, President Trump. Let's give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.

Donald Trump (38:20):
You don't know the law, Joe.

Kristen Welker (38:21):
Vice President Biden, your response.

Joe Biden (38:22):
Know the law, what he's telling you is simply not true. Check it out.

Donald Trump (38:25):
Well, check it out. They don't come back.

Joe Biden (38:26):
Check it out.

Kristen Welker (38:27):
All right. Let's move on to the next section.

Donald Trump (38:28):
But we don't have to worry about it, because they terminated it. So we don't have to worry about it anymore, Joe.

Kristen Welker (38:30):
Let's move on to the next section.

Joe Biden (38:32):
That's right. And you 525 kids not knowing where in God's name they're going to be and lost their parents.

Donald Trump (38:36):
Go ahead.

Kristen Welker (38:37):
All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called the talk. It happens regardless of class and income, parents who feel they have no choice, but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?

Joe Biden (39:14):
I do. I do. My daughter is a social worker and she's written a lot about this. She has her graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. And one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East Side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90% African-American, was to learn more about what was going on. I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts... For a traffic stop. "Put both hands on top of the wheel and don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you." But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, "When you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street. Making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over just, "Yes, sir. No-
