Why are you continue to do military maneuvers with South Korea?\" I said, \"Because North Korea is a problem, and we\'re going to continue to do it so we can control them. We\'re going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up and help. If not, it\'s going to continue.\" What has he done?

Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It\'s headed to the Supreme Court and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the Supreme Court does overturn that law, there\'s 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight.

But then I made a decision, run it as well as you can, to my people, great people, run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down. Everything\'s down. Here\'s the problem. No matter how well you run it, it\'s no good. What we\'d like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don\'t know that it\'s going to work. If we don\'t win, we will have to run it and we\'ll have Obamacare, but it\'ll be better run.

Far more than we\'re talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their healthcare. People that have been successful, middle-income people, been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families.

That\'s what\'s going to happen. Secondly, we\'re going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there\'s competition, that doesn\'t exist now, by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance, the reason why I had such a fight with 20 candidates for the nomination was I support private insurance. That\'s why. Not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare.
