66:25
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THIS FIRST
66:28
SEGMENT OF FIRST 2 MINUTES,
66:29
THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHRIS, I
66:30
WILL TELL YOU VERY SIMPLY WE
66:31
WON THE ELECTION.
66:31
>> ELECTIONS HAVE
66:34
CONSEQUENCES. WE HAVE THE
66:36
SENATE WE HAVE THE WHITE HOUSE
66:37
AND WE HAVE A PHENOMENAL
66:41
NOMINEE RESPECTED BY ALL TOP
66:44
TOP GOOD IN EVERY WAY GOOD IN
66:46
EVERY WAY IN FACT AS SOME OF
66:49
HER BIGGEST ENDORSERS ARE VERY
66:52
LIBERAL PEOPLE FROM NOTRE DAME
66:53
IN OTHER PLACES SO I THINK
66:54
SHE'S GOING TO BE FANTASTIC.
66:55
WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME. EVEN
66:58
IF WE DID IT AFTER THE
66:59
ELECTION ITSELF. I HAVE A LOT
67:00
OF TIME AFTER THE ELECTION AS
67:02
YOU KNOW, SO I THINK SHE WILL
67:03
BE OUTSTANDING SHE'S GOING TO
67:07
BE A AS GOOD AS ANYBODY THAT
67:09
HAS SERVED AND THAT COULD
67:11
REALLY FEEL WE HAVE A
67:12
PROFESSOR AT NOTRE DAME HIGHLY
67:13
RESPECTED BY ALL SAID SHE IS
67:13
THE SINGLE GREATEST STUDENT
67:16
HE'S EVER HAD HE'S BEEN A
67:17
PROFESSOR FOR A LONG TIME IN A
67:18
GREAT SCHOOL. AND WE WE WON
67:21
THE ELECTION AND THEREFORE WE
67:22
HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND
67:25
VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOWINGLY
67:26
WOULD SAY OTHERWISE AND BY THE
67:28
WAY THE DEMOCRATS THEY WOULD
67:30
EVEN THINK ABOUT NOT DOING IT
67:31
IF THEY HAD THE ONLY
67:31
DIFFERENCE IS TRY AND DO IT
67:33
FASTER THERE'S NO WAY THEY
67:33
WOULD GIVE IT UP. THEY HAD
67:37
MERRICK GARLAND BUT THE
67:38
PROBLEM IS THEY DIDN'T HAVE
67:39
THE ELECTIONS SO THEY WERE
67:41
STOPPED AND PROBABLY THAT
67:43
WOULD HAPPEN IN REVERSE ALSO
67:44
DEFINITELY WOULD VARIOUS, SO
67:46
WE WON THE ELECTION AND WE
67:47
HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO IT CHRIS.
67:48
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP. THANK SAME
67:52
QUESTION TO YOU VICE PRESIDENT
67:53
BIDEN YOU HAVE 2 MINUTES.
67:54
FIRST OF THANK YOU FOR DOING
67:58
THIS BECAUSE THEY WERE
67:59
DISMISSED A PRAYER VIGIL. THE
68:02
AMERICAN PEOPLE. RIGHT.
68:06
>> HAVE A SAY TO THE SUPREME
68:07
COURT NOMINEE IS AND THAT'S
68:09
ACRES WHEN THEY VOTE FOR A
68:10
UNITED STATES SENATORS AND
68:12
WHERE THEY VOTE FOR THE
68:12
PRESIDENT STATES. THEY'RE NOT
68:16
GOING TO GET THAT CHANCE NOW
68:17
BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
68:18
AN ELECTION ALREADY. ELECTION
68:19
HAS ALREADY STARTED. 10'S OF
68:22
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE
68:22
ALREADY VOTED. AND SHOULD
68:25
HAPPEN IS WE SHOULD WAIT. WE
68:28
SHOULD WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE
68:28
OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION IS
68:31
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
68:31
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET TO
68:32
EXPRESS THEIR VIEW HIS BY WHO
68:35
THEY ELECT THIS PRESIDENT WHO
68:36
THEY LIKED AS VICE PRESIDENT.
68:39
NO WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE IS THE
68:40
PRESIDENT'S MADE IT CLEAR. HE
68:41
WANTS TO GET RID OF THE
68:42
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
68:45
>> HE'S BEEN RUNNING AND THAT
68:46
HE RAN ON THAT AND AND
68:47
GOVERNING ON THAT. HE'S IN THE
68:50
SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING
68:51
TO GET RID THE THE AFFORDABLE
68:54
CARE ACT WILL STRIP 20 MILLION
68:56
PEOPLE FROM HAVING INSURANCE
68:59
HEALTH INSURANCE NOW IF IF IF
69:01
IT GOES INTO COURT AND THE
69:06
JUSTICE AND I NOTHING I'M NOT
69:07
OPPOSED THE JUSTICES AND SHE
69:08
SEEMS LIKE A VERY FINE PERSON.
69:10
BUT SHE'S WRITTEN BEFORE SHE
69:10
WENT THE BENCH WHICH IS HER
69:13
RIGHT. SHE THINKS THAT
69:14
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS NOT
69:15
CONSTITUTIONAL. THE OTHER
69:18
THING IS ON THE KOREAN IF INTO
69:19
THE STRUCK DOWN WHAT HAPPENS.
69:20
WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE
69:21
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED ONCE
69:22
AGAIN. A WOMAN COULD BE HELD
69:27
IN A MORE MONEY BECAUSE SHE
69:27
HAS A PREEXISTING CONDITION OF
69:30
PREGNANCY. WE'RE ABLE TO ME
69:31
THEY'RE ABLE TO CHARGE MORE
69:32
FOR THE SAME EXACT PROCEDURE
69:33
MAN DID GETS AND THAT ENDED
69:36
WHEN WE IN FACT PASSED THE
69:37
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND
69:39
THERE'S A 100 MILLION PEOPLE
69:40
HAVE PREEXISTING CONDITIONS
69:42
AND THEY'LL BE TAKEN AWAY AS
69:43
WELL. THOSE PREEXISTING
69:46
CONDITIONS THAT INSURANCE
69:47
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO LOVE
69:48
THIS AND SO IT'S JUST NOT
69:50
APPROPRIATE TO DO THIS BEFORE
69:53
THIS ELECTION. IF HE WINS THE
69:55
ELECTION IN THE SENATE IS
69:56
DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. HE
69:59
GOES FORWARD NOT WE SHOULD
70:00
WAIT UNTIL FEBRUARY ON A
70:02
100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH
70:03
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS AS FAR
70:05
SAY IS CONCERNED THE PEOPLE
70:06
ALREADY HAD THEY.
70:10
>> OKAY JUSTICE GINSBURG SAID
70:11
VERY POWERFULLY VERY STRONGLY
70:12
AT SOME POINT. 10 YEARS AGO OR
70:17
SO SHE SAID THE PRESIDENT AND
70:19
THE SENATE IS ELECTED FOR A
70:21
PERIOD OF TIME, BUT THE
70:22
PRESIDENT SELECTED FOR 4 YEARS
70:23
WE'RE NOT ELECTED FOR 3 NOT
70:24
ELECTED FOR 3 YEARS. SO WE
70:26
HAVE THE SENATE WE HAVE A
70:28
PRESIDENT ELECTED TO THE NECK
70:29
DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME
70:30
DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. WE
70:31
HAVE AN OPENING. I'M NOT
70:35
ELECTED FOR 3 ELECTED FOR 4
70:38
YEARS IN COUNTRY ALREADY IS
70:39
GOING JUMP TO 100 MILLION
70:40
PEOPLE IS TOTALLY WRONG WE GET
70:41
THAT NUMBER THE BIG PROBLEM
70:42
THAT YOU HAVE IS THAT YOU'RE
70:46
GOING TO EXTINGUISH
70:48
180 MILLION PEOPLE WITH THEIR
70:49
PRIVATE HEALTH CARE THAT
70:51
THEY'RE VERY SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

TRUTH SO CHEAP TAKE A LOOK AT
75:21
ALL OF THE DRUGS THAT WHAT
75:22
WE'RE DOING PRESCRIPTION DRUG

PRICES WOULD ALLOW OUR
75:26
GOVERNORS NOW TO GO TO OTHER
75:27
COUNTRIES TO BUY DRUGS BECAUSE
75:28
ONE JUST A TINY FRACTION THIS
75:31
IS OPEN OR YOU'LL BE HAPPY I'M

78:57
THE PROBLEM IS NO MATTER HOW
78:57
WELL YOU'RE AN OBAMA CARE.
79:01
IT'S A DISASTER, IT'S TOO THAT
79:04
DOESN'T WORK THAT SELLS YOU
79:08
WHAT WANT TO GET RID OF MY
79:09
UNDERSTAND IS SOMETHING I HAVE
79:10
GIVE YOU ROUGHLY EQUAL TIME
79:12
BUT LET THE VICE PRESIDENT
79:13
WELL THAT.
79:14
>> HE HAS NO PLAN FOR HEALTH
79:17
CARE AS WE CAN SENSE PLACE HE
79:22
SENDS DOWN WISHFUL THINKING HE
79:23
COULD AS EXECUTIVE ORDERS HAVE
79:25
NO POWER HE HAS A LOWER DRUG
79:26
COSTS FOR ANYBODY HAS BEEN
79:27
PROMISING HEALTH CARE PLAN.
79:30
>> SINCE HE GOT ELECTED, HE
79:31
HAS NOT LIKE ALMOST EVERYTHING
79:31
ELSE. HE TALKS ABOUT HE DOES
79:33
NOT HAVE A PLAN. HE DOESN'T
79:34
HAVE A PLAN AND THE FACT IS
79:38
THIS MAN DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
79:40
HE'S TALKING ABOUT POINTS ONE
79:41
FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER
79:42
VICE PRESIDENT. IF SENATE
79:47
REPUBLICANS WE WERE TALKING
79:48
ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT HERE
79:49
IF SENATE REPUBLICANS GO AHEAD
79:51
AND CONFIRM JUSTICE BARRETT.
79:56
THERE HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT
79:57
ENDING THE FILIBUSTER OR EVEN
79:59
PACKING THE COURT TO THE 9
80:02
JUSTICES THERE YOU CALL THIS A
80:03
DISTRACTION BY THE PRESIDENT
80:04
BUT IN FACT IT WASN'T BROUGHT
80:05
UP BY THE PRESIDENT.
80:07
>> IT WAS BROUGHT UP BY SOME
80:08
OF YOUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES
80:10
IN -8 THE CONGRESS, SO MY
80:11
QUESTION TO YOU AS YOU REFUSED
80:13
IN THE PAST TO TALK ABOUT IT
80:14
ARE YOU WILLING TO US TELL THE
80:16
AMERICAN PEOPLE TONIGHT
80:16
WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL
80:17
SUPPORT EITHER ENDING THE
80:22
FILIBUSTER.
80:23
>> OR PACKING THE POSITION
80:24
I'VE TAKEN THAT THAT WILL
80:25
BECOME THE ISSUE THE ISSUE IS
80:25
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD
80:26
SPEAK. YOU SHOULD GO OUT AND
80:30
VOTE. YOU'RE IN VOTING. NOW
80:30
VOTING LET YOUR SENATORS KNOW
80:34
HOW YOU FEEL ROADMAP THAT FACT
80:37
SURE YOU IN FACT TO LET PEOPLE
80:38
KNOW IS WHERE SENATOR RUSSIAN
80:40
I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THE
80:42
QUESTION WHY THAT BECAUSE U.S.
80:44
THE NEW IT JUST AS THEY ARE
80:46
LEFT WHAT ARE YOU A SON WHO IS
80:48
ON YOUR LIST JOE THIS YOU
80:50
RIGHT JUST AS I THINK THIS IS
80:54
SO IT'S ACTION ACCORDING TO
80:55
THE TO GIVE A LITANY OF ENDED
80:56
THE SEGMENT WE'RE GOING TO
80:56
MOVE ON TO THE SECOND SEGMENT
80:57
THAT WAS REALLY PRODUCTOR
80:58
SEGMENT. ONE.
81:00
>> KEEP THE APP AND MET THE
81:01
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND YOU. SHE
81:05
FACE 47 YEARS YOU'VE JENNA
81:05
THINK ALL RIGHT. THE SECOND
81:09
SUBJECT TO COVID-19 WHICH IS
81:10
AN AWFULLY SERIOUS LET'S TRY
81:15
TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT IT. WE
81:16
HAVE HAD MORE THAN 7 MILLION
81:17
CASES OF CORONAVIRUS AND THE
81:21
UNITED STATES AND MORE THAN
81:22
200,000 PEOPLE.
81:22
>> HAVE DIED AFTER WE PRODUCE
81:27
A VACCINE. EXPERTS SAY THAT IT
81:28
COULD BE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS
81:31
BEFORE WE COME BACK TO
81:32
ANYTHING APPROACHING NORMAL MY
81:36
QUESTION FOR BOTH OF YOU IS
81:38
BASED ON WHAT SAID AND DONE SO
81:42
FAR AND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID YOU
81:43
WOULD DO STARTING IN 2021. WHY
81:46
SHOULD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
81:47
TRUST YOU MORE THAN YOUR
81:48
OPPONENT. TO DEAL WITH THIS
81:52
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS GOING
81:53
FORWARD IN THIS CASE. THE
81:56
QUESTION GOES TO YOU FIRST SIR
81:57
2 MINUTES UNINTERRUPTED. GOOD
81:58
LUCK. 200,000 DEAD.
82:04
>> AS YOU SAID OVER 7 MILLION
82:04
INFECTED UNITED STATES. WE IN
82:08
FACT HAVE 5% 4% OF THE WORLD'S
82:10
POPULATION, 20% OF THE DEATHS.
82:13
40,000 PEOPLE DID A DAY OUR
82:16
CONTRACTING COVID IN ADDITION
82:20
TO THAT ABOUT BETWEEN 7.15 A
82:21
1000 PEOPLE THERE DIED. WHEN

HE WAS PRESENTED WITH THAT
82:24
NUMBER HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT
82:27
IS WHAT IS WHAT IS BECAUSE YOU
82:28
ARE WHO YOU ARE THAT'S WHY IT
82:31
IS THE PRESIDENT HAS NO PLAN.
82:36
HE HASN'T LAID OUT ANYTHING HE
82:37
KNEW ALL THE WAY BACK IN
82:39
FEBRUARY HOW SERIOUS THIS
82:40
CRISIS WAS. HE KNEW IT WAS A
82:41
DEADLY DISEASE. WHAT DID HE DO
82:44
HE'S ON TAPE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED
82:44
HE KNEW IT. HE SAID HE DIDN'T
82:49
TELL US OR GIVE PEOPLE WARNING
82:49
OF IT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT
82:50
TO PANIC AMERICAN PEOPLE. YOU
82:52
KNOW PANIC HE PANICKED. IN
82:54
ADDITION TO THAT WHAT DID HE
82:58
DO HE WOULD IN ANY WE WERE
83:00
INSISTING THAT THE CHINESE OF
83:01
THE PEOPLE WE HAD OF THE
83:02
GROUND IN CHINA SHOULD BE ABLE
83:03
TO GO TO AND DETERMINE FOR
83:04
THEMSELVES HOW DANGEROUS THIS
83:07
WAS HE DID NOT EVEN AS SHE TO
83:09
DO THAT HE TOLD US WHAT A
83:11
GREAT JOB SHE WAS DOING HE
83:13
SAID WE OWE HIM A DEBT OF
83:14
GRATITUDE FOR BEING SO
83:15
TRANSPARENT WITH US AND WHAT
83:16
DID YOU DO THEN HE THEN DID
83:21
NOTHING HE WAITED WAITED
83:23
WAITED, HE STILL DOESN'T HAVE
83:24
A PLAN I LAID OUT HER WERE TO
83:26
GO BACK WHAT WE SHOULD BE
83:28
DOING AND I LAID OUT AGAIN IN
83:31
JULY BUT WE SHOULD BE DOING WE
83:33
SHOULD BE PROVIDING ALL THE
83:34
PROTECTIVE GEAR POSSIBLY
83:36

83:37
THE HOUSE HAS PASSED IN ORDER
83:38
TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND GET
83:41
PEOPLE THE HELP THEY NEED TO
83:42
KEEP THEIR BUSINESSES OPEN
83:43
OPEN COST A LOT OF MONEY. YOU
83:46

83:47
AND GET OUT OF THE SAND TRAP
83:49

83:50
AND GO IN OVAL OFFICE AND
83:53
BRING TOGETHER THE DEMOCRATS

DIED A 200,001 PERSON IS TOO
84:08
MUCH IT'S CHINA'S FAULT AND
84:09

97:21
VERY HARD PSYCHOLOGICALLY TO
97:21
DO DIDN'T THINK WE SHOULD
97:23
CLOSE IT DOWN AND IT WAS
97:25
WRONG. AND AGAIN 2 MILLION

99:18
SAID BILLIONAIRES OF RAY HAS

HE'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST
99:50
PRESIDENT UNITED STATES TO
99:53
LEAVE OFFICE HAVING FEWER JOBS
99:54
IN HIS ADMINISTRATION THEN
99:55
WHEN HE BECAME PRESIDENT FEWER
99:58

WHO WEREN'T PUTTING THEMSELVES
100:13
IN THE WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT

WE COULD ALL TRYING TO MAKE IT
100:16
AND THE IDEA THAT HE IS
100:19
INSISTING THAT GO FORWARD AND
100:22
OPEN WHEN YOU HAVE ALMOST HALF
100:24
THE STATES IN AMERICA WITH A
100:26

IS HE WON'T OPEN UP WHY

DOESN'T HE TAKE CARE OF THE
100:35
MARRIAGE. HE CAN'T FIX THE
100:37
ECONOMY UNTIL YOU FIX THE
100:39
COVID CRISIS AND HE HAS NO

101:03
BUSINESSES, NOTHING THEY'RE

TAYLOR CASE DECIDED NOT TO
118:05
CHARGE ANY OF THE POLICE WITH
118:07
HOMICIDE YOU SAID IT RAISES
118:08
THE QUESTION QUOTE WHETHER
118:11
JUSTICE COULD BE EQUALLY
118:12
APPLIED IN AMERICA, DO YOU
118:15
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A
118:16
SEPARATE BUT UNEQUAL SYSTEM OF

THIS COUNTRY IN EDUCATION AND
118:27
WORK IN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN

HONORABLE MEN AND WOMEN, THEY
118:35
RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY TO
118:36
TAKE CARE OF US, BUT THERE ARE
118:39
SOME BAD APPLES AND WHEN THEY
118:40
OCCUR WHEN THEY FIND THEM THEY
118:41
HAVE TO BE SORTED OUT. THEY
118:42
HAVE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
118:43
THEY HAVE TO BE HELD
118:46
ACCOUNTABLE. AND WHAT I'M
118:47
GOING TO DO IS PRESS THE
118:49
UNITED STATES IS CALLED

OFFICERS, THE POLICE CHIEFS
118:58
AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK THIS
118:59
OUT WE'RE GOING TO WORK THIS
119:01

119:15
SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE ARE HELD

ACCOUNTABLE WHEN AND BY THE
119:18
WAY VIOLENCE IN RESPONSE IS
119:19
NEVER APPROPRIATE NEVER

FEDERAL AGENCIES TO END RACIAL
119:49
SENSITIVITY TRAINING THAT

SENSITIVITY TRAINING TO VIEW
120:26
OR A CERTAIN PERSON. YOU HAD
120:29
NO STATUS IN LIFE IT WAS SORT
120:30
OF A REVERSAL AND IF YOU LOOK
120:33
AT THE PEOPLE WE WOULD PAY
120:34
PEOPLE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
120:36
OF DOLLARS TO TEACH VERY BAD
120:36
IDEAS AND FRANKLY, VERY SICK
120:41

THIS COUNTRY THEY WERE
120:51
TEACHING PEOPLE THAT OUR
120:53
COUNTRY IS A HORRIBLE PLACE.
120:54
IT'S A RACIST PLACE AND THEY
120:55
WOULD TEACHING PEOPLE TO HATE
120:57
OUR COUNTRY AND I ALLOW THAT
120:58
TO HAPPEN VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN
121:02
NOBODY'S DOING THAT HE'S JUST
121:03
RACES YOU JUST DON'T HERE'S
121:05
TODAY. I KNOW A LOT LET HIM
121:06
FINISH. THE FACT IS THAT THERE
121:11
IS RACIAL INSENSITIVITY PEOPLE
121:11
HAVE TO BE MADE AWARE OF WHAT
121:16
OTHER PEOPLE FEEL LIKE WHAT
121:17
THAT'S WHAT IN SEOUL. SOME
121:18
WHAT IS THE MEANING TO THEM.
121:20
>> IT'S IMPORTANT PEOPLE KNOW
121:21
THEY DON'T WANT TO MANY PEOPLE
121:23
DON'T WANT TO HURT OTHER
121:24
PEOPLE'S FEELINGS BUT IS TO ME
121:25
IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. IT
121:26
MAKES A GIGANTIC DIFFERENCE IN
121:27
THE WAY A CHILD IS ABLE TO
121:30
GROW UP AND HAVE A SOCIAL
121:31
SENSE OF SELF ESTEEM. IT'S A
121:32
LITTLE BIT LIKE HOW THIS GUY
121:36
HIS FRIENDS LOOK DOWN ON SO
121:37
MANY PEOPLE LOOK DOWN THEIR
121:38
NOSE ON PEOPLE LIKE IRISH
121:40
CATHOLICS LIKE ME AND GROW UP
121:43
AND SCREAM AND THEY LOOK DOWN
121:44
ON PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE MONEY
121:45
THEY LOOK DOWN ON PEOPLE WHO
121:46
ARE OF A DIFFERENT FAITH THEY
121:47
LOOK DOWN ON PEOPLE OR
121:51
DIFFERENT COLOR. IN FACT WE'RE
121:52
ALL AMERICANS THE ONLY WAY
121:53
WE'RE GOING TO BRING THIS
121:54
COUNTRY TOGETHER IS BRING
121:55
EVERYBODY TOGETHER THERE'S
121:57
NOTHING WE CAN NOT DO IF WE DO
121:59
IT TOGETHER WE CAN TAKE THIS
122:01
ON AND WE CAN DEFEAT RACES
122:02
EYES
122:02
>> I MEAN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OR
122:04
DURING THE OBAMA.
122:06
>> BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THERE
122:07
WAS TREMENDOUS DIVISION THAT
122:10
WAS HATRED YOU LOOK FERGUSON
122:11
YOU LOOK AT YOU GO TO VERY
122:14
MANY PLACES LOOK AT OAKLAND,
122:16
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED CAN LOOK
122:18
WHAT HAPPENED IN BALTIMORE,
122:19
LOOK WHAT FRANKLY WAS MORE
122:21
VIOLENT THAN WHAT I'M EVEN
122:23
SEEING NOW WHAT THE REASON
122:24
THIS IS THAT THE KEY DEMOCRATS
122:26
HAVE RUN THESE CITIES WANT TO
122:28
TALK LIKE YOU ABOUT LAW AND
122:31
ORDER VIOLATES I HAVEN'T MEANT
122:32
I LOVE YOU IN FAVOR OF LAW AND
122:33
ORDER I'M IN FAVOR OF LAW YOU
122:37
FOLLOW THE ORDERS HIS LET
122:43
ORDER WITH JUSTICE WHERE
122:43
PEOPLE GET TREATED FAIRLY AND
122:45
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS
122:47
VIOLENT CRIME DOWN 15%, IN OUR
122:52
ADMINISTRATION FAR IT'S GONE
122:53
UP BY HIS WIFE DOWNEY MUCH
122:59
EVERY RECORD IN THE MISTER
123:00
PRESIDENT VERY HAPPY BECAUSE
123:01
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT
123:03
LONG WAIT WE HAD TROUBLE WITH
123:05
DEMOCRATIC RUN CITIES THAT HAS
123:07
BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN
123:08
HOMICIDES IN AMERICA.
123:11
>> THIS SUMMER PARTICULARLY
123:12
AND YOU OFTEN TO BLAME THAT ON
123:15
DEMOCRATIC MAYORS AND
123:16
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS BUT IN
123:16
FACT THERE HAVE BEEN
123:17
EQUIVALENT SPIKES IN
123:20
REPUBLICAN LED CITIES LIKE
123:21
TULSA AND FORT WORTH. SO THE
123:23
QUESTION IS IS THIS REALLY A
123:24
PARTY ISSUE. I THINK IS A
123:28
PARTY ISSUE YOU CAN BRING IN A
123:29
COUPLE OF EXAMPLES BUT IF YOU
123:30
LOOK AT CHICAGO WHAT'S GOING
123:31
ON IN CHICAGO WHERE 53 PEOPLE
123:33
WERE SHOT AND A DIET SHOT. IF
123:37
YOU LOOK AT NEW YORK WHERE
123:38
IT'S GOING UP LIKE NOBODY'S
123:39
EVER SEEN ANYTHING THE NUMBERS
123:40
ARE GOING 100 15200%. CRIME
123:44
WHAT IT IS IN RACE, HE WAS
123:47
GOING ON AND HE DOESN'T WANT
123:48
TO SAY LAW AND ORDER BECAUSE
123:49
HE CAN'T BECAUSE YOU LOSE HIS
123:52
RADICAL LEFT SUPPORTERS AND
123:53
ONCE HE DOES THAT IT'S OVER
123:54
WITH IF HE EVER GOT TO RUN
123:56
THIS COUNTRY AND THEY RENTED
123:57
THE WAY HE WOULD WANT TO RUN
123:59
IT WE WOULD HAVE WE WERE SO
124:01
NERVOUS ON BY THE ARE SUBURBS
124:04
WOULD BE GUN AND YOU WOULD SEE
124:05
PROBLEMS SUBURB UNLESS YOU
124:08
TOOK A WRONG TURN DON'T HAVE
124:12
WAIT A MINUTE I WAS RAISED IN
124:12
THE SUBURBS, THIS IS NOT 1950
124:15
ALL THESE DOG WHISTLES AND
124:17
RACISM, NO WORK ANYMORE
124:18
SUBURBS ARE BY AND LARGE
124:20
INTEGRATED THERE'S MANY PEOPLE
124:21
TODAY DRIVING THEIR KIDS TO
124:22
SOCCER PRACTICE AND ORDER
124:24
BLACK AND WHITE AND HISPANIC
124:26
IN THE SAME CAR AS THERE HAVE
124:28
BEEN ANY TIME THE PAST WHAT
124:29
REALLY IS A THREAT TO THE
124:30
SUBURBS AND THEIR SAFETY.
124:33
>> IS HIS FAILURE TO DO WITH
124:35
COVID THERE DIED IN THE
124:36
SUBURBS, HIS FAILURE TO DEAL
124:37
WITH THE ENVIRONMENT THEY'RE
124:40
BEING FLOODED THERE BE BURNED
124:41
OUT BECAUSE HE'S REFUSED DO
124:43
THATS WHY THE SUBURBS OR IN
124:44
TIME I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT
124:45
THIS ISSUE OF LAW AND ORDER
124:46
THOUGH, AND IN THE JOINT
124:48
RECOMMENDATION THAT CAME FROM
124:50

FACE AND I'M NOT TOTALLY
125:23
OPPOSED TO DEFUNDING. THE
125:24
POLICE OFFICES MATTER FACT,
125:25
POLICE AND LOCAL POLICE, THE
125:28
ONLY ONE TO FUNDING IN HIS
125:29
BUDGET CALLS FOR 400 MILLION
125:30
DOLLAR CUT IN LOCAL LAW
125:31
ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE, THEY
125:32
NEED MORE ASSISTANCE. THEY
125:36
NEED WHEN THEY SHOW UP FOR A
125:37
9.11 CALL TO HAVE SOMEONE WITH
125:39
THEM AS A PSYCHOLOGIST OR
125:40
PSYCHIATRIST TO KEEP THEM FROM
125:42
HAVING TO USE FORCE AND BE
125:43
ABLE TO TALK PEOPLE DOWN WE
125:45
HAVE TO HAVE COMMUNITY
125:46
POLICING LIKE WE HAD BEFORE
125:48
WHERE THE OFFICERS GET TO KNOW
125:49
THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES.
125:51
THAT'S WHEN CRIME WENT DOWN IT
125:53
DIDN'T GO UP IT WENT DOWN.
125:56
>> AND SO WE HAVE TO BEING
125:57
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
125:58

130:23
>> WHEN THE PRESIDENT SEEKS A
130:25
SECOND TERM. IT IS GENERALLY A
130:26
REFERENDUM ON HIS RECORD. BUT
130:29
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN YOU LIKE
130:30

130:32
SAYINGS WHICH IS DON'T COMPARE

130:39
ALTERNATIVE. LOOK AT AT MOST
130:41
OF YOUR RECORDS, I'M GOING TO
130:42
ASK EACH OF YOU. WHY SHOULD

VOTERS ELECT NEW PRESIDENT
130:48
OVER YOUR OPPONENT IN THIS
130:49
SEGMENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL
130:50
GO FIRST 2 MINUTES.
130:55
>> BECAUSE THERE'S NEVER BEEN
130:56
AN ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT
130:58
WHO HAS DONE MORE THAN I'VE
130:59
DONE. IN A PERIOD OF 3 AND A
131:00
HALF YEARS AND THAT'S DESPITE
131:01
THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX AND YOU
131:04
SAW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WITH
131:05
HILLARY CLINTON WHERE WAS A
131:06
WHOLE BIG CON JOB. BUT DESPITE
131:07
GOING THROUGH ALL OF THESE
131:08
THINGS WERE AT A FIGHT. BOTH
131:10
FLANKS AND BEHIND ME YOU KNOW
131:13
AND ABOVE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN
131:14
AN ADMINISTRATION THAT'S DONE
131:15
WHAT I'VE DONE. THE GREATEST
131:18
BEFORE COVID CAME IN THE
131:19
GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY
131:21
LOWEST, SIMPLER UNEMPLOYMENT
131:22
NUMBERS, EVERYTHING WAS GOOD
131:22
EVERYTHING WAS GOING BY THE
131:25
WAY. THERE WAS UNITY GOING TO
131:26
HAPPEN PEOPLE WERE CALLING ME
131:27
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS
131:28
THEY WERE CALLING. AND THERE
131:31
WAS SAYING IT'S TIME MAYBE AND
131:32
THEN WHAT HAPPENED WE GOT HIT,
131:33
BUT NOW A BUILDING IT BACK UP
131:35
AGAIN. A REBUILDING OF THE
131:37
MILITARY INCLUDING SPACE FORCE
131:38
AND ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS
131:41
FIXING OF THE V A WHICH WAS A
131:45
MESS HIM 308,000 PEOPLE DIED
131:47
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE
131:47
PROPER HEALTH CARE IT WAS A
131:49
MESS AND WE NOW GOT A 91%
131:52
APPROVAL RATING AT THE VA ARE
131:53
VETS WE TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS
131:56
BUT WE'VE REBUILT OUR MILITARY
131:58
THE JOB THAT WE'VE DONE AND
131:59
TELL YOU SOME SOME PEOPLE SAY
131:59
MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT BY
132:01
THE END OF THE FIRST TERM HAVE
132:05
APPROXIMATELY 300 FEDERAL
132:06
JUDGES AND COURT OF APPEALS
132:08
JUDGES, 300. AND HOPEFULLY 3
132:11
GREAT SUPREME COURT JUDGES
132:14
JUSTICES THAT IS A RECORD THE
132:16
LIKES OF WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE
132:18
AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE
132:19
REASONS I'VE SO MANY JUDGES
132:21
BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND
132:21
HIM LEFT BE A 128. JUDGES TO
132:26
FILL WHEN YOU LEAVE OFFICE YOU
132:27

132:28
LIKE YOU DO THAT THEY LEFT A
132:32
128 OPENINGS AND IF I WERE A
132:34
MEMBER OF HIS PARTY BECAUSE
132:36

132:37
PHILOSOPHY ON SAY IF YOU LEFT.
132:42
A 128 OPENINGS YOU CAN'T BE A
132:44
GOOD PRESIDENT YOU CAN'T BE A
132:45
GOOD VICE PRESIDENT, BUT I
132:46
WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE IT
132:47

BY THE END OF THIS TERM AND TO
132:52
SERVE 300 JUDGES, IT'S A
132:54
RECORD.
132:54

133:00
ELECT NEW PRESIDENT AS OPPOSED
133:01
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP,

PRESIDENT'S UNINTERRUPTED
133:03
UNDER THIS PRESIDENT WE'VE

133:16
ASKED TO FIX IT. I DID WE A
133:17
ECONOMY AND HE CAUSED THE
133:20
RECESSION WITH REGARD TO BE
133:23
WEAKER. THE FACT IS THAT I'VE
133:24
GONE HEAD TO HEAD WITH PUTIN
133:26
AND MADE IT CLEAR TO HIM WE'RE
133:27
NOT GOING TO TAKE IT EVEN
133:31

136:18
BURNED MILLIONS OF ACRES THEY

HAVE DISPLACED HUNDREDS OF
136:22
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

THEY'RE BLAMED THE FIRES ON
136:26
CLIMATE CHANGE MISTER

THINK THE SCIENCE KNOWS OVER
136:29
HERE FOR YEARS. YOU HAVE
136:33
PULLED THE U.S. OUT OF THE
136:34
PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD YOU WOULD
136:38
ROLL BACK A NUMBER OF OBAMA
136:40
ENVIRONMENTAL RECORDS. WHAT DO
136:42
YOU BELIEVE ABOUT THE SCIENCE
136:43
OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT
136:45
WILL YOU DO IN THE NEXT 4
136:47
YEARS TO CONFRONT IT.
136:49
>> I WANT CRYSTAL CLEAN WATER
136:51
AND AIR I WANT BEAUTIFUL CLEAN
136:53
AIR. WE HAVE NOW THE LOWEST
136:54
CARB AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR
136:55
NUMBERS RIGHT NOW. WE ARE
136:58
DOING PHENOMENALLY. BUT I
137:00
HAVEN'T DESTROYED OUR
137:01
BUSINESSES ARE BUSINESSES
137:02
AREN'T PUT OUT OF COMMISSION
137:05
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PARIS
137:06
ACCORD IT WAS A DISASTER FROM
137:08
OUR STANDPOINT AND PEOPLE ARE
137:10
ACTUALLY VERY HAPPY ABOUT
137:11
WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE OUR
137:12
BUSINESS IS DOING WELL AS FAR
137:13
AS THE FIRES AGAIN SOON. YOU
137:15
NEED FOREST MANAGEMENT IN
137:15
ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE.
137:18
THE FARS FLOORS ARE LOADED UP
137:20
WITH TREES DEAD TREES YEARS
137:21
OLD AND THEY LIKE TINDER AND
137:24
LEAVES AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU
137:27
DROP A CIGARETTE AND THEN THE
137:28
WHOLE FAR HAS BEEN SENT YOU'VE
137:29
GOT TO HAVE FAR AS MANAGE WHAT
137:32
DO YOU WHAT YOU BELIEVE ABOUT
137:32
THE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE
137:35
SIR I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO
137:37
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HAVE
137:39
IMMACULATE AIR IMMACULATE
137:40
WATER AND DO WHATEVER ELSE
137:41
WEEKEND THAT'S GOOD, YOU KNOW
137:42
WHAT PLANTING A MILLION TREES
137:43
THE BILLION TREE TREE PROJECT.
137:45
>> THAT IS VERY EXACTLY THAT
137:46
HE THAT HUMAN. POLLUTION GAS
137:51
OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
137:52
CONTRIBUTES TO THE GLOBAL
137:53
WARMING UP I THINK LOT OF
137:54
THINGS DO BUT I THINK TO AN
137:55
EXTENT. YES I THINK TO AN
137:56
EXTENT YES, BUT I ALSO THINK
137:57
WE HAVE TO DO BETTER
137:58
MANAGEMENT OF A FARCE. EVERY
138:00
YEAR. I GET THE CALL.
138:03
CALIFORNIA IS BURNING
138:03
CALIFORNIA IS BURNING. IF THAT
138:07
WAS CLEANED IF THAT WERE IF
138:09
YOU HAD FAR US MANAGEMENT GOOD
138:11
FOREST MANAGEMENT. YOU
138:12
WOULDN'T BE GETTING THOSE
138:13
CALLS YOU KNOW IN EUROPE THEY
138:14
LIVE THERE FOR US CITIES THAT
138:15
CALL FOR US CITIES. THEY
138:17
MAINTAIN THEIR FAR AS THEY
138:18
MANAGE THEIR 4 HOURS. I WAS
138:20
WITH THE HEAD OF A MAJOR
138:21
COUNTRY. IT'S A FAR CITY. HE
138:25
SAID SIR WE HAVE TREES THAT
138:28
ARE FAR MORE THEY THEY IGNITE
138:29
MUCH EASIER THAN CALIFORNIA.
138:31
THEY SHOULDN'T BE THAT
138:32
PROBLEM. I SPOKE WITH THE
138:33
GOVERNOR ABOUT I'M GETTING
138:34
ALONG VERY WELL WITH THE
138:35
GOVERNOR, BUT HE SAID YOU KNOW
138:35
AT SOME POINT YOU CAN EVERY
138:40
YEAR HAVE HUNDREDS OF
138:40
THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF LAND HAS
138:43
BURNED TO THE GROUND OF STUFF
138:44
THAT'S BURNING DOWN BECAUSE OF
138:45
A LACK OF AN ANSWER IF YOU
138:46
BELIEVE IN THE SCIENCE OF
138:48
CLIMATE CHANGE.
138:48
>> WHY HAVE YOU ROLL BACK THE
138:53
OBAMA PLAYING POWER PLAN WHICH
138:54
LIMITED CARBON EMISSIONS AND
138:55
POWER PLANTS WHY HAVE YOU
138:57
RELAX AS IT WAS DRIVING ENERGY
138:59
PRICES THROUGH THE SKY HAVE
138:59
YOU RELAX FUEL ECONOMY
139:03
STANDARDS THAT WE'RE GOING TO
139:05
CREATE MORE POLLUTION FROM NOT
139:06
BROADLY BECAUSE WHAT'S
139:07
HAPPENING IS THE CAR IS MUCH
139:08
LESS EXPENSIVE AND IT'S A MUCH
139:11
SAFER CAR.
139:12
>> AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A
139:12
TINY DIFFERENCE AND THEN WHAT
139:13
WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE
139:14
COST OF THE CAR YOU WOULD HAVE
139:17
AT LEAST DOUBLE AND TRIPLE THE
139:19
NUMBER OF CARS PURCHASE WE
139:19
HAVE THE OLD SLUGS OUT THERE
139:23
1012 YEARS OLD. IF YOU DID
139:24
THAT THE CAR WOULD BE SAFER.
139:25
IT WOULD BE MUCH CHEAPER BY
139:28
THEY LOT OF CARS OFF THE
139:30
MARKET BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD BE
139:31
ABLE TO AFFORD A CAR. SO AND
139:34
BY THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO SEE
139:35
HOW THAT TURNS OUT BUT A LOT
139:36
OF PEOPLE AGREE WITH ME MANY
139:38
PEOPLE. THE CAR HAS GOTTEN SO
139:40
EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THEY HAVE
139:42
COMPUTERS ALL OVER THE PLACE
139:43
FOR AN EXTRA LITTLE BIT OF GAS
139:47
LEAK AND DOES NOT INTEND AND
139:48
I'M OK WITH ELECTRIC CARS TO I
139:49
THINK I'M ALL FOR ELECTRIC
139:50
CARS THEY'VE GIVEN BIG
139:51
INCENTIVES ELECTRIC CARS. BUT
139:52
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN
139:53
CALIFORNIA IS JUST CRAZY.
139:57
>> VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN I'D
139:57
LIKE YOU TO RESPOND TO THE
139:59
PRESIDENT'S CLIMATE CHANGE
140:00
RECORD, BUT I ALSO WANT TO ASK
140:03
YOU ABOUT PROPOSED 2 TRILLION
140:04
DOLLARS IN GREEN JOBS, YOU
140:08
TALK ABOUT NO LIMITS NOT
140:08
ABOLISHING BUT NEW LIMITS ON
140:11
FRACKING AND THEN THE USE OF
140:12
FOSSIL FUELS TO GENERATE
140:13
ELECTRICITY BY 2035. AND 0 NET
140:16
EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES
140:17
BY 2050. THE PRESIDENT SAYS A
140:21
LOT OF THESE THINGS WOULD TANK
140:23
THE ECONOMY AND COST MILLIONS
140:24
OF JOBS IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG.
140:25
NUMBER ONE NUMBER 2.
140:30
>> IF IN FACT ONE WHEN
140:31
ORDERING ADMINISTRATION
140:31
RECOVERY ACT I WAS ABLE TO I
140:33
WAS IN CHARGE ABLE TO BRING
140:34
DOWN THE COSTS OF RENEWABLE
140:37
ENERGY TO CHEAPER THAN OR AS
140:38
CHEAP AS COAL AND GAS AND OIL,
140:41
NOBODY'S GOING TO BUILD
140:42
ANOTHER OF A COAL-FIRED PLANT
140:44
IN AMERICA. NO ONE'S GONNA
140:45
BUILD ANOTHER OIL-FIRED
140:46
PLANNED AMERICA. THEY'RE GOING
140:47
TO MOVE TO RENEWABLE ENERGY
140:51
NUMBER ONE NUMBER 2 WE'RE
140:51
GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE
140:53
ABLE TO TAKE FEDERAL FLEET IN
140:56
TURN INTO A FLEET THAT RUN ON
140:58
THEIR ELECTRIC VEHICLES MAKING
141:00
SURE THEY CAN DO THAT ABOUT
141:03
500,000 CHARGING STATIONS AND
141:04
ALL OF THE HIGHWAY SO WE'RE
141:05
GOING TO BE BUILDING IN THE
141:06
FUTURE WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A
141:07
NEW ECONOMY THAT IN FACT IS
141:08
GOING TO PROVIDE FOR THE
141:11
ABILITY OF US TO TAKE
141:13
4 MILLION BUILDINGS AND MAKE
141:15
SURE THAT THEY IN FACT ARE OR
141:17
WHETHER EYES IN A WAY THAT IN
141:19
FACT FROM NEW DEAL AMID
141:21
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS GAS AND OIL
141:22
BECAUSE THE HEAT WILL NOT BE
141:24
GOING OUT THERE SO MANY THINGS
141:24
THAT WE CAN DO NOW TO CREATE
141:27
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
141:29
JOBS. WE CAN GET TO NET 0 IN
141:30
TERMS OF ENERGY PRODUCTION BY
141:34
2035, NOT ONLY NOT COST PEOPLE
141:38
JOBS CREATING JOBS CREATING
141:39
MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS,
141:42
NOT 15 BUCKS AN HOUR BUT
141:45
PREVAILING WAGE BY HAVING A
141:46
NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IN
141:47
FACT IS GREEN AND THE FIRST
141:48
THING I WILL DO I WILL REJOIN
141:52
THE PARIS ACCORD I WILL JOIN
141:53
THE PARIS ACCORD BECAUSE WITH
141:55
US OUT OF A LOOK WHAT'S
141:56
HAPPENING. IT'S ALL FALLING
141:58
APART AND TALK ABOUT SOMEONE
141:59
WHO HAS NO NO RELATIONSHIP TO
142:00
DO WITH FOREIGN POLICY.
142:04
BRAZIL, THE RAIN FOREST BRAZIL
142:06
ARE BEING TORN DOWN OR BEING
142:08
RIPPED OUT MORE MORE CARBON IS
142:10
ABSORBED IN THAT RAIN FOREST
142:11
AND EVERY BIT OF CARBON THAT
142:12
SUBMITTED THE UNITED STATES
142:14
INSTEAD OF DOING SOMETHING
142:16
ABOUT THAT I WOULD BE
142:17
GATHERING UP AND MAKING SURE
142:18
WE HAD TO COME THE COUNTRIES
142:19
OF THE WORLD COMING UP WITH
142:21
20 BILLION HERE'S 20 BILLION
142:21
DOLLARS STOP STOP. TEARING
142:26
DOWN THE FOREST AND IF YOU
142:28
DON'T THEN YOU'RE GOING TO
142:29
HAVE CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT
142:31
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE
142:33
KIND ABOUT THE ARGUMENT. THE
142:34
PRESIDENT TRUMP BASICALLY SAYS
142:34
THAT YOU HAVE TO BALANCE.
142:37
>> ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS AND
142:38
ECONOMIC INTERESTS AND HE'S
142:39
DRAWN HIS LINE.
142:44
>> WELL HE HAD DRAWN A LINE HE
142:45
STILL FOR EXAMPLE MAKE SURE
142:45
THAT WE HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE
142:47
THAT METHANE NOT A PROBLEM WE
142:49
CAN DO YOU CAN NOW EMIT MORE
142:50
METHANE WITHOUT IT BEING A
142:51
PROBLEM METHANE. THIS IS A GUY
142:51
WHO SAYS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
142:54
TO HAVE MILEAGE STANDARDS FOR
142:55
AUTOMOBILES, IT EXISTS NOW.
142:56
THIS IS A GUY WHO SAYS THAT.
143:02
THE FACT IT IT'S ALL TRUE,
143:03
HERE'S THE ABOUT THE NEW DEAL
143:05
AND IT'S NOT TO BE AND I WERE
143:07
20 BILLION AS YOU SAID I SAY
143:09
IT'S 100 TRILLION DOLLAR I'M
143:11
TALKING ABOUT IT THEY WANT TO
143:14

100 THAT'S MORE MONEY THAN
143:30
COUNTRY COULD MAKE THE LEADERS
143:36
IT WILL NOT BUY THE KATE ITS

CHAIR I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T
143:37
STUDIED YOUR PLAN.
143:40

143:42
4 MILLION BUILDINGS WHETHER
143:42
RISING 2 MILLION POUNDS OVER 4
143:45
YEARS BUILDING ONE AND A HALF
143:46
MILLION ENERGY EFFICIENT.
143:51
HOLMES. SO THE QUESTION
143:52
BECOMES SOME THE PRESIDENT IS
143:53
SAYING I THINK SOME PEOPLE WHO
143:54
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT WOULD
143:57
SAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
143:58
GOING TO COST A LOT OF MONEY
143:59
AND HURT THE ECONOMY WHAT IT
144:00
COULD DO IS GOING TO CREATE
144:01
THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS
144:03
GOOD PAYING JOBS. LET HIM
144:05
FINISH ARE HERE NOT TO DO THAT
144:07

AT THE BALANCE DEFINITELY I
152:03
DON'T THINK WELL I HOPE WE
152:03
DON'T NEED THEM. IN TERMS OF
152:05
THE ELECTION ITSELF. BUT FOR
152:06
THE BALANCE I THINK SO BECAUSE
152:10
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS
152:10
INCREDIBLE. I JUST HEARD THAT
152:12
READ TODAY WHERE AT LEAST ONE
152:13
PERCENT OF THE BALLOTS TO
152:13
2016. WE'RE INVALIDATED THEY
152:20
THEY TAKE AND WE DON'T WE

BALLOTS. THEY'RE BEING SOLD TO
152:49
BEING DUMPED IN RIVERS, THIS
152:51
IS A HORRIBLE THING FOR A
152:52
COUNTRY IS AND THIS IS NOT IS
152:54
NO THIS IS NOT GOING END WELL
152:57
THEY'RE NOT AS IS LIVE STATES
152:58
I HAD BALLOTS FOR THE LAST A
153:03
DECADE OR MORE 5 INCLUDING 2
153:05
REPUBLICAN STATES. AND YOU
153:06
DON'T HAVE TO SOLICIT THE
153:07
BALLOT. IT SENT TO YOU IT SENT
153:08
TO YOUR HOME. WHAT WE'RE
153:10
SAYING IS THEY'RE SAYING IS
153:11
THAT HAS TO BE A POSTMARK BY
153:15
THIS TIME BY ELECTION DAY IF
153:18
YOU DIDN'T GET INTO OF THE 7TH
153:20
8TH 98TH IT STILL SHOULD BE
153:22
COUNTED. JUST AFRAID OF
153:23
COUNTING THE VOTES TO NEW WITH
153:27
YOU I WAS 11 PRESIDENT BIDEN
153:30
BUSY SO WRONG WHEN YOU MAKE
153:31
HAPPEN NOW GIVES ME IS VICE
153:33
PRESIDENT BIDEN THE BIGGEST
153:34
PROBLEM IN FACT OVER THE YEARS
153:35
WITH MAIL IN VOTING HAS NOT
153:36
BEEN FRAUD HISTORICALLY. IT IS
153:41
BEEN THAT SIZABLE NUMBER
153:42
SOMETIMES HUNDREDS OF
153:43
THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS WERE
153:45
THROWN OUT BECAUSE HAVE NOT
153:46
BEEN PROPERLY FILLED OUT OR
153:48
THERE IS SOME OTHER
153:48
IRREGULARITY OF THAT NASTY
153:49
FROM THE DEADLINE. SO THE
153:50
QUESTION I HAVE IS.
153:51
>> ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THE
153:53
SUPREME COURT WITH A JUSTICE
153:56
BARRETT. WE'LL SETTLE ANY
153:57
DISPUTE, I'M CONCERNED THAT
153:58
ANY COURT WHICH SET LIST
153:59
BECAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL WHEN
154:01
YOU YOU FILE WHEN YOU GET A
154:02
BALLOT. AND YOU FILL IT OUT.
154:07
>> YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN
154:08
AFFIDAVIT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW
154:09
YOU HAVE SOMEONE SAY THAT THIS
154:12
IS ME YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO IF
154:13
IN FACT YOU CAN VERIFY THAT
154:14
YOU WHEN THE BEFORE THE BALLOT
154:14
IS THROWN OUT. THAT'S
154:17
SUFFICIENT TO BE ABLE TO COUNT
154:19
THE BALLOTS BECAUSE SOMEONE
154:20
MADE A MISTAKE AND NOT DOT IN
154:24
THE CORRECT DIJE WHO THEY
154:24
VOTED FOR TESTIFY SAY WHO THEY
154:27
VOTED FOR SAY TO THAT IS
154:31
TOTALLY LEGITIMATE.
154:32
>> ALL RIGHT SWAPPING I SYSTEM
154:37
YOU HAVE YOU KNOW IT CAN'T BE
154:38
DONE YOU KNOW IT CAN'T AND
154:40
ALREADY ARRIVED IN IN THE
154:46
FINAL S WE CAN KEEP THAT SIT
154:48
IN A STATUS ELECTION WORKERS
154:49
CURRENTLY BY LAW 8 STATES FROM
154:52
EVEN BEGINNING THE PROCESS.
154:57
BALLOT EVEN TAKE THEM OUT OF
154:59
THE ENVELOPES AND LOT UNTIL
155:00
ELECTION DAY THAT MEANS THAT
155:01
IT'S LIKELY BECAUSE THERE'S
155:01
GOING TO BE A HUGE INCREASE IN
155:03
MAIL IN BALLOTING THAT WE ARE
155:07
NOT GOING TO KNOW ON ELECTION
155:08
NIGHT WHO THE WINNER IS THAT
155:09

THE MAKING OF ONE PERSON, I

PRESIDENT TRUMP. DID AND IN
160:18
SOME WAYS IT'S THE ONLY WAY HE
160:21
KNOWS WHAT TO DO BUILD THOSE

OVER THE MODERATOR BULLDOZED
160:22
OVER CHRIS WALLACE, AND AT

I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY WOULD
160:29
HAVE BEEN BY THE PRESIDENT'S
160:29
BEHAVIOR IN THE PRESIDENT'S
160:33
PERFORMANCE. IF IT IS IT WAS A
160:35
PURE TRAIN WRECK. I DON'T KNOW
160:37
HOW THAT HELP ANYBODY IF IF

161:03
FIND OKAY DID THIS POLITICALLY
161:04
HELP ANYBODY. I WILL SAY THIS
161:09
JOE BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN
161:10
TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE
161:11
ESSENTIALLY. PRESIDENT TRUMP
161:15
IS A FRAUD A BULLY AND PLANT.
161:18
THAT WAS ONE THING THAT SEEM
161:20
TO GET THROUGH. I THINK AT
161:21
TIMES AND CERTAINLY. PRESIDENT
161:23
TRUMP PLAYED THE ROLE OF THE
161:25
BULLY. QUITE WELL. THE TRUMP
161:28
CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN TRYING TO
161:29
PAINT JOE BIDEN IS OUT OF IT
161:30
AND CAPTIVE OF THE LEFT. I
161:33
THINK HIS FOLKS ARE GOING TO
161:36
THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT
161:36
SCORED SOME POINTS HERE THERE.
161:40
BUT I YOU KNOW I LOOK AT IT I
161:41
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
161:41
GOING TO LOOK AT THIS AND FEEL
161:44
PERHAPS A TAD EMPATHETIC FOR
161:46
ANYBODY THAT HAD TO
161:46
PARTICIPATE IN THIS.
161:50
>> LET ME GO TO ANDREA

MITCHELL RIGHT ANDREA MANY OF
161:54
THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED

ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS
161:55
CAME TRUE IN TERMS OF THE
161:57
PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY TO TRY TO
162:01
GET UNDER. JOE BIDEN HE WENT
162:02
AFTER HIS SON HUNTER CONDUCT A
162:03
NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, INCLUDING
162:06
WHEN VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS
162:09
TALKING ABOUT HIS SON BEAU WHO
162:10
HONORABLY SERVING AS A
162:11
SOLDIER.
162:13
>> TRUE AT ANY, BUT THIS WAS
162:14
SUCH A HOT MESS. YOU CAN STILL
162:17
CAN FOUGHT JOE BIDEN PERHAPS
162:19
FOR LETTING THE PRESIDENT GET
162:24
HIM RATTLED AND FOR NOT
162:25
DRILLING DOWN ON THE TAX ISSUE
162:26
AND OTHER ISSUES. BUT FRANKLY
162:30
THE FORMAT AND THAT YOU HAVE
162:31
TO YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THE
162:32
MODERATOR IN THE WAY THE
162:33
QUESTIONS WERE POSED. ONCE
162:35
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ROLLING
162:36
OVER THEM AND VOTERS IN THEM
162:37
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT
162:40
COVID NEARLY. AS MUCH IS RACE
162:42
AND VIOLENCE AND PROTESTS AND
162:43
IT WAS REALLY REALLY IN THE
162:46
BALLPARK OF THE PRESIDENT
162:48
BECAUSE HE KEPT BRINGING
162:48
THINGS BACK TO THAT ISSUE AND
162:49
NOT LETTING JOE BIDEN ANSWER A
162:51
QUESTION. SO BY BLOWING IT ALL
162:54
UP AND RUNNING ROUGHSHOD OVER
162:56
EVERYONE ELSE HE DIDN'T LET
162:58
JOE BIDEN MAKE THE POINTS THAT
163:00
HE WAS PREPARED TO MAKE UNTIL
163:01
PERHAPS THE LAST HALF HOUR
163:02
LAST HOUR PERHAPS 45 MINUTES
163:03
WHERE BIDEN SEEMED TO REGAIN
163:06
HIS FOOTING AND THE CONTRAST
163:07
WAS CLEAR BUT I I THEN
163:11
WATCHING DEBATES COVERING
163:12
DEBATES SINCE 1976, I'VE NEVER
163:15
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS I
163:16
DON'T THINK ANY OF US HAVE
163:18
COMPARED TO ANY DEBATE IN
163:19
PRESIDENTIAL HISTORY. WAS A
163:21
DISGRACE, FRANKLY. THE
163:25
PRESIDENT JUST DID NOT OBSERVE
163:26
ANY OF THE FORMAT. HIS OWN
163:28
CAMPAIGN AGREED TO. SO I'M NOT
163:31
SURE WHAT JOE BIDEN COULD HAVE
163:32
DONE OTHER THAN TRYING TO GET
163:33
A WORD IN AND TRYING TO ANSWER
163:36
THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED.
163:40
>> LET ME GO TO HOLLY JACKSON
163:41
WHO IS THAT THE DEBATE HALL, I
163:43
MEAN COUPLE THINGS HERE YOU
163:44
SEE THAT FAMOUS MAXIM INSIDE
163:45
TRUMPWORLD IS LET TRUMP BE
163:48
TRUMP. HE DEFINITELY WITH
163:49
TRUMP AND EVEN SEE EVEN KIND
163:50
OF A SUPERSIZED VERSION OF
163:52
HIMSELF. SO YOU WHETHER OR NOT
163:54
THAT WAS PART OF THE STRATEGY
163:55
I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOU ON
163:56
WHETHER OR NOT CAMPAIGN WITH
163:57
GOING IN THERE WITH THAT
164:01
MOTIVATION. AND BIDEN ON THE
164:02
OTHER HE DID HAVE HIS
164:03
OPPORTUNITIES DID HE MAKE THE
164:04
MOST OF THEM OR DID HE DID HE
164:05
LOSE OPPORTUNITIES.
164:10
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS ON
164:11
THAT'S ABOUT IT WHEN YOU TALK
164:11
ABOUT THE IDEA OF THE
164:12
PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY GOING
164:13
INTO THIS AND THE IDEA OF
164:14
LETTING TRUMP BE TRUMP AS IS
164:16
SO OFTEN SAID LISTEN THE
164:18
SOURCES CLOSE TO THE
164:20
PREPARATIONS HERE AT SAID THEY
164:21
WANTED TO SEE THE PRESIDENT GO
164:21
ON ATTACK THAT WAS PART OF
164:23
WHAT THEY WERE COMING INTO
164:24
THIS WITH OBVIOUSLY THAT
164:26
HAPPENED THAT WAS AN
164:27
INCREDIBLY AGGRESSIVE DONALD
164:27
TRUMP ON STAGE TONIGHT. HE
164:30
WENT AFTER AS EXPECTED HUNTER
164:31
BIDEN MULTIPLE TIMES OF
164:32
COURSE, THE VICE PRESIDENT'S
164:34
SON. YOU TALK ABOUT TONIGHT AT
164:36
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN BEING ON
164:37
DEFENSE IT TO THAT DEGREE
164:40
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE
164:41
INTERRUPTIONS FRANKLY FROM THE
164:43
PRESIDENT IT SEEMED LIKE IT
164:45
WAS DIFFICULT FOR JOE BIDEN TO
164:46
BE ABLE TO PUSH BACK IN ANY
164:47
SUBSTANTIVE WAY WHEN THE
164:49
PRESIDENT WAS SORT OF CREDIT
164:50
AT TAT WITH THESE ATTACKS ON
164:52
BIDEN REPEATEDLY OVER AND OVER
164:53
AGAIN ON HUNTER BIDEN I CAN
164:55
TELL YOU THAT THERE'S SOME
164:58
APPRECIATION FROM PEOPLE IN
165:01
TRUMP WORLD FOR THOSE HUNTER
165:02
BIDEN TAX THAT IS SOMETHING
165:03
HE'S GOING TO BE HEARING OVER
165:04
THE NEXT 2448 HOURS AND BEYOND
165:06
AS JOE POINTS OUT THERE ARE
165:07
SOME DIFFERENT MOMENTS THAT
165:09
PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT PRESIDENT
165:10
TRUMP ARE SEIZING ON TO TO SAY
165:12
LISTEN HE WAS ON HIS GAME HE
165:13
HAD ENERGY IS IS SORT OF
165:13
THINKING YEAR. HE CAME OUT AND
165:16
ATTACKED ON THE OTHER HAND I
165:18
THINK IT IS NOTABLE WE TALK
165:19
ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS
165:21
DEBATE A COUPLE OF POINTS AND
165:23
THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT
165:24
SIMPLY DID NOT SAY IT CANNOT
165:26
GO UNNOTICED THAT JOE BIDEN
165:26
THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT
165:27
DIRECTLY CALLED PRESIDENT
165:28
TRUMP A RACIST PRESIDENT TRUMP
165:31
DID NOT RESPOND TO THAT THE
165:33
PRESIDENT WAS DIRECTLY ASKED
165:34
TO DENOUNCE WHITE SUPREMACY
165:35
AND THE PROUD BOYS THE
165:38
PRESIDENT SAID STAND BACK AND
165:39
STAND BY WHICH IS NOT A
165:40
DENUNCIATION THE PRESIDENT WAS
165:42
DIRECTLY ASKED TO URGE CALM TO
165:43
HIS SUPPORTERS DURING THE VOTE
165:44
COUNT AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY.
165:46
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT DO
165:47
THAT I THINK SUBSTANTIVELY
165:48
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS
165:49
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE
165:50
HEARING ABOUT OVER THE NEXT
165:50
COUPLE OF DAYS AND JUST TO
165:51
GIVE YOU A SENSE I HAVE TO
165:52
TELL YOU INSIDE THIS DEBATE
165:55
HALL AND THEN OTHER DEBATE
165:56
THIS WAS VERY DIFFERENT FOR A
165:57
LOT OF REASONS NOTABLY FROM
165:58
SOME OF THE COVID PRECAUTIONS
165:59
AND THE MUCH SMALLER AUDIENCE
166:00
IT WAS A MUCH MORE INTIMATE
166:02
HALL FEELING AND THAT MADE IT
166:05
JARRING FRANKLY TO SEE THIS
166:06
CHAOS ON THE STAGE GO DOWN
166:07
JUST AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS
166:08
INSIDE THE ROOM HERE.
166:12

166:23

FIRST TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT A
166:26
LOT OF FOCUS OBVIOUSLY AND
166:27
WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID HIS
166:28
PERFORMANCE. ISOLATING IF YOU
166:32
CAN JOE BIDEN HIS REACTION TO
166:35
IT LOSING HIS TEMPER TIMES HOW
166:36
MUCH IS THAT FOR HIM.
166:41
>> I LISTEN ANYBODY WHO TRIES
166:42
TO CHARACTERIZE THIS DEBATE
166:46
AND SOMEHOW A QUICK IN TERMS
166:48
OF THE BEHAVIOR OF THESE 2
166:49
CANDIDATES IS NOT BEING FAIR
166:50
TO JOE BIDEN DONALD TRUMP WAS
166:54
A BULLY HE WAS
166:55
NON-PRESIDENTIAL HE WAS
166:59
FRANKLY OUTRAGEOUS. IT WAS TO
167:02
WATCH IT AS AN AMERICAN IS THE
167:04
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
167:05
AND HE BEHAVED LIKE A 12TH
167:08
GRADER. IT WAS TERRIBLE AND
167:09
JOE BIDEN I THINK SHOWED
167:13
PRESIDENTIAL SELF-CONTROL NOW
167:14
DID HE CALL TELLING TO BE
167:16
QUIET A COUPLE OF TIMES
167:18
FRANKLY I YOU KNOW I WAS THE
167:21
GUY AND CHRIS SMALLING AS I
167:22
MEAN I KNOW IT MUST BE HARD TO
167:24
CONTROL IT. BUT HE REALLY GOT
167:27
RUN OVER BY DONALD TRUMP'S
167:29
OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR ON THAT
167:31
STAGE TONIGHT NOW WILL IT HURT
167:33
DONALD TRUMP, POLITICALLY I'M
167:34
NOT SURE IT WILL WITH HIS
167:35
SUPPORTERS. BUT I GUARANTEE IT
167:37
WON'T HELP HIM WITH THOSE
167:38
WOMEN IN THE SUBURBS, IT WILL
167:38
NOT HELP HIM.
167:41
>> WELL THAT WAS THE QUESTION
167:42
I WANTED TO ASK RICH LOWRY WHO
167:42
OF COURSE IS THE EDITOR OF THE
167:43
CONSERVATIVE NATIONAL REVIEW.
167:46
I MEAN LOOK IF YOU ARE DONALD
167:47
TRUMP SUPPORTER THIS WAS GREAT
167:49
NIGHT FOR YOU YOU LOVE THIS
167:51
GUY BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE
167:52
UNDECIDED VOTERS WHAT ABOUT
167:54
SUBURBAN WOMEN WHAT ABOUT
167:54
PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE FENCE DO
167:56
YOU FEEL THAT AGGRESSIVE. A
167:58
PERFORMANCE WAS A GOOD LOOK
168:00
FOR DONALD TRUMP.
168:03
>> WELL I THINK THE WHOLE
168:04
NIGHT WAS DISPIRITING I
168:06
WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF
168:07
THERE'S NOT ANOTHER
168:08
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AND THE
168:09
CYCLE AND THE VERY LEAST I
168:09
THINK THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
168:10
COMMISSION HAVE TO CONSIDER
168:13
CUTTING OFF THE MIKES OF THE
168:14
PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPOSED TO THE
168:15
PERSON WHO'S NOT SUPPOSED TO
168:15
BE SPEAKING IN THIS TIME IT
168:17
ISN'T BUT THIS TRUMP'S
168:21
STRATEGY AND EVEN WAS A
168:23
STRATEGY THIS IS NATURE THIS
168:24
IS THE WAY HE IS AND I THINK
168:27
YOU A FLUSTERED BY THAT TIME
168:28
SHUT UP MAN WASN'T GREAT AT
168:30
THE BEGINNING FROM FROM JOE
168:31
BIDEN BITE WAS A VASE OF ON
168:32
SOME KEY QUESTIONS BUT REALLY
168:36
IMPORTANTLY HE DIDN'T BUCKLE
168:37
YOU KNOW, HE STOOD THERE FOR
168:38
90 MINUTES AND TOOK IT AND
168:39
GAVE US GOOD TO SEE GOT AND
168:41
WITH TRUMP. I THINK THE
168:43
PROBLEM IS ESPECIALLY WITH
168:43
HUNTER BIDEN SOME OF THE
168:44
POINTS. HE'S TRYING TO MAKE.
168:47
WE DIDN'T REALLY LAND THAT
168:48
WELL BECAUSE OF HIS OWN JAG
168:49
STYLE AND HIS OWN OVER
168:53
INTERRUPTING SO I CLEAR I'M
168:56
NOT SURE IT HURTS HIM BUT
168:57
SOMEONE WHO IS ON SETTLED BY
168:58
THE WAY HE'S CONDUCTED HIMSELF
168:59
AS PRESIDENT BUT IS ON THE
169:00
