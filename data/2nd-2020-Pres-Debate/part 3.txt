Joe Biden (00:00):
If you get pulled over just, yes, sir, no, sir. Hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 ... child of a $300,000 a year person or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is, there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said, we've never lived up to it, that we hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal. Well, guess what, we have never, ever lived up to it. But we've always constantly been moving the needle further and further to inclusion, not exclusion. This is the first president to come along and says, that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better healthcare, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses, all the things we can do. And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth as well as it is to be free from violence.

Kristen Welker (01:06):
President Trump, same question to you, and let me remind you of the question. I would like you to speak directly to these families, do you understand why these parents fear for their children?

Donald Trump (01:15):
Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years, he never did a thing, except in 1994, when he did such harm to the black community, and they were called ... and he called them superpredators. And he said that, he said it, superpredators. And they never lived that down. 1994, your crime bill, the superpredators. Nobody has done more for the black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might've wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had to twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it, including some very liberal people that cried in my office. They cried in the Oval Office.

Donald Trump (02:15):
Two weeks later, they're out saying, "Gee, we have to defeat him." Criminal justice reform, prison reform, Opportunity Zones with Tim Scott, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for Opportunity Zones. It's one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made, biggest beneficiary, the black and Hispanic communities. And then Historically Black Colleges and Universities, after three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great. They came into the office and I said, "What are you doing?" After three years, I said, "Why do you keep coming back?" Because we have no funding." I said, "You don't have to come back every year." "We have to come back."

Donald Trump (02:57):
Because President Obama would never give them long-term funding and I did. 10 year long-term funding and I gave them more money than they asked for because I said, "I think you need more." And I said, "The only bad part about this is I may never see you again." Because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

Kristen Welker (03:19):
Okay, and we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President.

Joe Biden (03:23):
My response to that is I never ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for awhile, this is a guy who said, "The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail." And go on my website, get the quote, the date when he said it, "not enough people." He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, and the people who are going to maraud our cities. This is a guy who in the Central Park Five, five innocent black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were guilty of the crimes they were suggested. Look and granted, he did in fact, let 20 people ... he commuted 20 people's sentences.

Joe Biden (04:12):
We commuted over 1,000 people's sentences, over 1,000. The very law he's talking about is a law that in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of those things we should be doing, there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.

Donald Trump (04:53):
But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago? Even less than that. Why didn't you when you vice president? You keep talking about all these things you're going to do, and you're going to do this, but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.

Joe Biden (05:09):
We did-

Donald Trump (05:09):
You know Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I thought you did a good job, I would've never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician, I ran because of you.

Kristen Welker (05:24):
All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that. And then I do have some questions for both of you.

Joe Biden (05:28):
Well, I'll tell you what I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is, you know who I am. You know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am ... The character of the country is on the ballot. Our character's on the ballot, look at us closely.

Kristen Welker (05:52):
Let me ask some follow up-

Donald Trump (05:53):
Excuse me-

Kristen Welker (05:53):
Please respond and then we're going to have follow up questions.

Donald Trump (05:55):
If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, Iraq. If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, that calling you a corrupt politician-

Joe Biden (06:09):
Nobody's calling me-

Donald Trump (06:10):
They're calling it the laptop from hell.

Kristen Welker (06:10):
President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about the issue-

Donald Trump (06:13):
Excuse me, [crosstalk 00:06:13] the laptop from hell.

Joe Biden (06:13):
Nobody.

Kristen Welker (06:14):
President Trump, we're talking about race right now. And I do want to stay on the issue of race. President Trump you-

Joe Biden (06:20):
I have to respond to that. Because look-

Kristen Welker (06:21):
Please, very quickly.

Joe Biden (06:22):
There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he's accusing me of is a Russian plant. They have said that this has all the ... five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him and his good friend, Rudy Giuliani.

Donald Trump (06:44):
You mean the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You got to be kidding me-

Joe Biden (06:51):
That's exactly what was told.

Donald Trump (06:51):
This is where he's going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?

Kristen Welker (06:55):
Gentlemen, I want to stay on the issue of race.

Donald Trump (06:56):
You have to be kidding, here we go again with the Russia. Boy, oh, boy.

Kristen Welker (06:59):
We're going to continue on the issue of race.

Donald Trump (07:01):
Can't believe that one.

Kristen Welker (07:01):
Mr. President you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that black professional athletes exercising their First Amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?

Donald Trump (07:24):
Well, you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter, they were chanting, "Pigs in a blanket," talking about police, pigs, pigs, talking about our police. "Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon." I said, "That's a horrible thing." And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter, I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.

Kristen Welker (07:55):
What do you say to Americans who are concerned by that rhetoric [crosstalk 00:00:07:58]?

Donald Trump (07:58):
I don't know. I mean, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and Opportunity Zones-

Donald Trump (08:03):
... got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and Opportunity Zones, I took care of Black colleges and universities, I don't know what to say, they can say anything, I mean, they can say anything. It's a very... Makes me sad, because I am the least racist person, I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience, I'm the least racist person in this room.

Kristen Welker (08:26):
Okay. Vice President Biden, let me ask you very quickly and then I have a follow-up question for you.

Joe Biden (08:30):
Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history, he pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. Started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he's getting rid of those Mexican rapists, he's ban Muslims because they're Muslims, he has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to... About the Proud Boys, last time we were on stage here he said, "I tell them to stand down and stand ready." Come on, this guy has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn.

Kristen Welker (09:04):
President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then I have a follow-up question.

Donald Trump (09:07):
No, he made a reference to Abraham Lincoln, where did that come in? I mean-

Joe Biden (09:10):
You said you're Abraham Lincoln.

Donald Trump (09:12):
... where did that..... No.

Joe Biden (09:13):
You said-

Donald Trump (09:14):
I said, "Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community."

Joe Biden (09:19):
And I'm saying-

Donald Trump (09:20):
I didn't say, "I'm Abraham Lincoln," I said, "Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community." Now, you have done nothing other than the Crime Bill, which put-

Joe Biden (09:32):
Oh, God.

Donald Trump (09:33):
Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail.

Joe Biden (09:39):
Not true.

Kristen Welker (09:39):
All right, let me ask Vice President Biden a question.

Donald Trump (09:41):
And you know what? They remember it because if you look at what's happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly, just take a look at what's happening out there.

Kristen Welker (09:49):
Let me ask Vice President Biden about... Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context, crime bills that you supported in the '80s and '90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession, they are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they are uncles, whose families are still to this day, some of them suffering the consequences. So, speak to those families, why should they vote for you?

Joe Biden (10:11):
One of the things is that in the '80s we passed 100 percent, all 100 senators voted for a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs, it was a mistake. I've been trying to change since then particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that in fact we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense, they should be going into treatment across the board, that's what we should be spending money. And that's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by our Republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem, they should be going into treatment. That's what we've been trying to do, that's what I'm going to get done because I think the American people have now seen that in fact it was a mistake to pass those laws relating to drugs, but they were not in the Crime Bill.

Kristen Welker (11:04):
[crosstalk 00:11:04].

Donald Trump (11:04):
But, why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk, no action with these politicians, why didn't he get it? "That's what I'm going to do when I become president." You were vice president along with Obama as your president, your leader, for eight years, why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done, now you're saying you're going to get it done because you're all talking and no action, Joe.

Kristen Welker (11:25):
Your response.

Joe Biden (11:25):
We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-

Donald Trump (11:27):
You didn't get anything done.

Joe Biden (11:28):
We got 38,000 prisoners [ crosstalk 00:11:30]-

Donald Trump (11:30):
You got nothing done.

Joe Biden (11:31):
38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison, we have... There were over a thousand people who were given clemency. [inaudible 00:03:38]. In fact, were the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern and practice of police departments and what they were doing, how they're conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process, we lost an election, that's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.

Donald Trump (11:57):
I just have-

Kristen Welker (11:57):
Your response and then we're going to move on to climate change.

Donald Trump (11:58):
... one question, why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, "I'm going to do that, I'm going to do this." You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison, now you're saying you're going to get... You're going to undo that, why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama. You know why, Joe? Because you're all talk and no action.

Joe Biden (12:22):
[crosstalk 00:00:12:23].

Kristen Welker (12:22):
All right, Vice President Biden, and then we're going to move on to the next section.

Joe Biden (12:25):
We had a Republican Congress, that's the answer.

Kristen Welker (12:31):
Okay.

Donald Trump (12:32):
Well, you got to talk them into it, Joe, sometimes you got to talk them into it.

Kristen Welker (12:35):
We're going to move on to our next section which is climate change.

Donald Trump (12:37):
... like I did with criminal justice reform, I had to talk Democrats into it.

Joe Biden (12:41):
You did what we already had done.

Kristen Welker (12:41):
Gentlemen, we're running out of time so we got to get onto climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector, Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.

Donald Trump (13:08):
So, we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs, I do love the environment, but what I want is that cleanest crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time, not Joe, I haven't heard Joe use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but here's what we can't do. Look at China, how filthy it is, look at Russia, look at India, it's filthy, the air is filthy. The [Paris Accord 00:00:13:55], I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly.

Donald Trump (14:03):
When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice, they were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord, it was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030, Russia goes back to a low standard, and we kicked in right away, it would have been... It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water, and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.

Kristen Welker (14:41):
Vice President Biden-

Donald Trump (14:41):
And we haven't destroyed our industries.

Kristen Welker (14:44):
Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.

Joe Biden (14:47):
Climate change, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world we don't have much time, we're going to pass the point of no return within the next 8 to 10 years. Four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up... To limit the emissions, will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. Here's where we have a great opportunity. I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as the labor, the people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan.

Joe Biden (15:32):
Because what it does, it will create millions of new good paying jobs, we're going to invest in, for example, 500,000... Excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market of the future. In the meantime, China is doing that. We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of...

Joe Biden (16:03):
So they don't leak as much energy saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs. By the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening and what right now, by the way, Wall Street firms indicated that my plan, my plan will in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This is from Wall Street and I'll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does. Not on climate, just on economy.

Kristen Welker (16:41):
President Trump, your response.

Donald Trump (16:42):
They came out and said very strongly $6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, if you look at his plan, his-

Joe Biden (16:56):
[crosstalk 00:16:56].

Donald Trump (16:57):
... his environmental plan, do you know developed it? AOC plus three, they know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate and they're all hopping through hoops for AOC plus three. Look, their real plan cost a hundred trillion dollars. If we had the best year in the history of our country for a hundred years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window, it would be a lovely thing.

Donald Trump (17:32):
This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen and this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend a hundred trillion dollars. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It's a hundred trillion dollars. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little, tiny, small windows and many other things-

Kristen Welker (17:57):
Okay.

Donald Trump (17:57):
And many other things. And many other things.

Kristen Welker (17:58):
Okay, let me have the vice-president respond.

Donald Trump (17:58):
It is crazy.

Kristen Welker (17:59):
We're running out of time and we have a lot more questions to get back to.

Donald Trump (18:01):
You'll destroy our country.

Kristen Welker (18:02):
So let's hear from the vice president. I have a number of more question..

Joe Biden (18:07):
I don't know where he comes from. I don't know where he comes up with these numbers.

Kristen Welker (18:09):
Queens.

Joe Biden (18:09):
A hundred trillion dollars, give me a break. This plan has been endorsed by every major, every major environmental group and every labor group, labor, because they know the future lies. The future lies in us being able to breathe and they know they're good jobs and getting us there.

Joe Biden (18:29):
By the way, the fastest growing industry in America is the electric, excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It's the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45, 50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner if we go the route I'm proposing.

Kristen Welker (18:54):
President Trump-

Donald Trump (18:55):
Excuse me.

Kristen Welker (18:55):
Please respond and then I have his follow up.

Donald Trump (18:56):
We are energy independent for first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had to fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It's extremely expensive. Kills all the birds. It's very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China and the fumes coming up, if you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clear.

Donald Trump (19:29):
One other thing, solar-

Joe Biden (19:31):
Find me a scientist who says that.

Donald Trump (19:31):
I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful yet to really run our big, beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world.

Joe Biden (19:42):
False.

Donald Trump (19:42):
It's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're going to have the greatest economy in the world, but if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry you want. And what about fracking?

Kristen Welker (19:54):
Let me-

Donald Trump (19:54):
Now we have to ask him about fracking.

Kristen Welker (19:56):
Let me allow the Vice President Biden to respond.

Joe Biden (19:57):
I never said I oppose fracking.

Donald Trump (20:00):
You said it on tape.

Joe Biden (20:02):
Show the tape, put it on your website.

Donald Trump (20:04):
I'll put it on.

Joe Biden (20:05):
Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he's flat lying.

Kristen Welker (20:09):
Would you rule out about banning fracking?

Joe Biden (20:11):
I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need, we need other industries to transition, to get to ultimately a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking, capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money in doing it, but it's a transition to that.

Kristen Welker (20:38):
I have one more question in this pile then-

Donald Trump (20:40):
Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow.

Joe Biden (20:45):
Good.

Donald Trump (20:45):
I am against fracking. Until he got the nomination, he went to Pennsylvania. Then he said, "But you know what Pennsylvania?" He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.

Joe Biden (20:54):
Fracking on federal land. I said, no fracking and/or oil on federal land.

Kristen Welker (20:59):
Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas, there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?

Donald Trump (21:21):
The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we've produced for Hispanic, for Black, for Asian, it's nine times greater the percentage gain than it was under in three years than it was under eight years of the two of them to put it nicely, nine times more.

Donald Trump (21:48):
Now somebody lives, I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying, but they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it and I saved it again a number of months ago, when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it.

Donald Trump (22:04):
Say what you want to bet relationship. We got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant again and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.

Kristen Welker (22:17):
Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.

Joe Biden (22:21):
My response is that those people live on what they call fence lines. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that in fact, pollute, chemical plants and oil plants and refineries that pollute.

Joe Biden (22:33):
I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claymont, Delaware and there are more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is any place, including in Houston at the time. When my mom get in the car and when there are first frost to drive me to school, turning the windshield wiper, there'd been oil slick in the window. That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it's not a matter of what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? You impose restrictions on the pollutions that if the pollutants coming out of those fence line communities.

Kristen Welker (23:07):
Okay. I have one final question called.

Donald Trump (23:08):
Would he close down the oil industry?

Kristen Welker (23:10):
It falls-

Donald Trump (23:10):
Would you close dow the oil industry?

Joe Biden (23:12):
By the way, I have a transition from the old industry, yes.

Donald Trump (23:15):
Oh, that's a big statement.

Joe Biden (23:15):
I will transition. It is a big statement.

Donald Trump (23:17):
That's a big statement.

Joe Biden (23:18):
Because I would stop.

Kristen Welker (23:19):
Why would you do that?

Joe Biden (23:21):
Because the oil industry pollutes, significantly.

Donald Trump (23:24):
Oh, I see. Okay.

Joe Biden (23:24):
Here's the deal-

Donald Trump (23:25):
That's a big statement.

Joe Biden (23:26):
Well if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, over time, and I'd stopped giving to the oil industry, I'd stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't get federal subsidies to the gas, oh, excuse me to solar and wind.

Donald Trump (23:45):
Yeah.

Joe Biden (23:46):
Why are we giving it to oil industry?

Donald Trump (23:47):
We actually give it to solar and wind. That's maybe the biggest statement. In terms of business, that's the biggest statement.

Kristen Welker (23:53):
Okay.

Donald Trump (23:53):
Because basically what he's saying is-

Kristen Welker (23:55):
We have one final question, Mr. President.

Donald Trump (23:55):
... he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?

Kristen Welker (24:03):
Okay, Vice President Biden, let me give you 10 seconds.

Kristen Welker (24:03):
Okay.

Donald Trump (24:03):
Remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, is-

Kristen Welker (24:03):
Vice President Biden, let me give you 10 seconds to respond-

Donald Trump (24:04):
Ohio.

Kristen Welker (24:05):
... and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden.

Joe Biden (24:07):
He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2035 is in energy production, by 2050 totally.

Kristen Welker (24:21):
All right. One final question to both of you-

Donald Trump (24:22):
Is he going to get China to do it?

Kristen Welker (24:23):
No, we're finished with this-

Donald Trump (24:23):
Is he going to get China to do it?

Kristen Welker (24:24):
We have to move onto our final question.

Joe Biden (24:25):
No, I'm going to rejoin Paris Accord and make China abide by what they agreed to.

Donald Trump (24:30):
[Crosstalk 00:24:31].

Kristen Welker (24:30):
All right. This is about leadership, gentlemen. And this first question does go to you, President Trump. Imagine this is your inauguration day. What will you say in your address, to Americans who did not vote for you? You'll each have one minute, starting with you, Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump (24:47):
We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now we're rebuilding it and we're doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time, et cetera. But, I will tell you, go back.

Donald Trump (25:01):
Before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together. We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates; number one in the class, everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify.

Donald Trump (25:28):
Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I'm cutting taxes, and he wants to raise everybody's taxes and he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a Depression, the likes of which you've never seen. Your 401(k)s will go to hell, and it'll be a very, very sad day for this country.

Kristen Welker (25:49):
All right. Vice President Biden, same question to you: what will you say during your inaugural address to Americans who did not vote for you?

Joe Biden (25:57):
I will say, I'm an American President. I represent all of you, whether you voted for me or against me, and I'm going to make sure that you're represented. I'm going to give you hope. We're going to move; we're going to choose science over fiction. We're going to choose hope over fear. We're going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better.

Joe Biden (26:19):
We can grow this economy, we can deal with the systemic racism. At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run and moved and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs. That's the fact, that's what we're going to do. And I'm going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency, honor, respect. Treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance. And I'm going to make sure you get that. You haven't been getting it the last four years.

Kristen Welker (26:53):
All right, I want to thank you both for a very robust hour and a half, a fantastic debate. Really appreciate it. President Trump, Former Vice President Joe Biden. Thank you to Belmont University for hosting us tonight, and most importantly, thank you to those watching tonight. Election day is November 3rd. Don't forget to vote. Thank you everyone and have a great night.

Joe Biden (27:16):
Thank you.

Speaker 1 (29:00):
And now it's time to hear from you and get your reaction to this final debate of 2020. We're going to put the numbers up on the screen. If you want to dial in, 202 is the area code for all of our numbers. 748-8920 if you support President Trump; if you support Vice President B-
